_SOS_ i do n't
_eqn_ and _eqn_ _EOS_
_eqn_ where _eqn_ is
i do n't know
_eqn_ and _eqn_ are
i do n't think
_SOS_ it 's a
where _eqn_ is the
_SOS_ i 'm not
_eqn_ _eqn_ and _eqn_
_SOS_ it 's not
of _eqn_ and _eqn_
_SOS_ thank you _EOS_
where _eqn_ and _eqn_
_SOS_ i did n't
in terms of the
_SOS_ in this case
_SOS_ that 's what
_SOS_ i think you
on the other hand
_SOS_ i can n't
_eqn_ where _eqn_ _EOS_
i 'm going to
is given by _eqn_
_SOS_ i think it
_SOS_ in order to
_SOS_ on the other
i 'm pretty sure
i thought it was
in the case of
_eqn_ where _eqn_ and
i 'm not sure
_SOS_ in this section
that 's what i
i think it 's
in this section we
_SOS_ that 's a
where _eqn_ is a
_SOS_ in this paper
came here to say
_SOS_ that 's the
_SOS_ where _eqn_ is
_SOS_ thanks for the
in this paper we
_SOS_ _cite_ and _cite_
_SOS_ relevant __url__ _EOS_
_SOS_ came here to
_eqn_ and _eqn_ is
_SOS_ you do n't
_eqn_ i e _EOS_
_SOS_ this is the
for _eqn_ and _eqn_
i do n't have
the equations of motion
_SOS_ i 'm a
_eqn_ is given by
_SOS_ in section we
if you do n't
_SOS_ that 's not
_eqn_ with _eqn_ _EOS_
do n't want to
with respect to the
_SOS_ it 's the
_SOS_ let _eqn_ be
_SOS_ i have a
_cite_ and _cite_ _EOS_
_SOS_ note that the
_SOS_ thank you for
_SOS_ i 'm pretty
in this case the
i was going to
we would like to
and _eqn_ is the
i see what you
_SOS_ i think i
it is easy to
what you did there
_SOS_ i think he
of the form _eqn_
but i do n't
with _eqn_ and _eqn_
_SOS_ let us now
i did n't know
_SOS_ what do you
with respect to _eqn_
given by _eqn_ _EOS_
see what you did
_SOS_ do n't forget
_SOS_ in the case
_SOS_ i thought it
_SOS_ this means that
_SOS_ _cite_ where _eqn_
_SOS_ how do you
_SOS_ in other words
i have no idea
_SOS_ let us consider
i do n't see
_SOS_ i think that
can be written as
_SOS_ amp amp _EOS_
by _eqn_ where _eqn_
_SOS_ thank you i
_eqn_ and _eqn_ respectively
_SOS_ there 's a
in the context of
the _eqn_ and _eqn_
you do n't have
_SOS_ do n't worry
that _eqn_ and _eqn_
_SOS_ i 've been
as _eqn_ where _eqn_
_SOS_ i 'm sure
_eqn_ for _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ you can n't
in terms of _eqn_
_SOS_ i think the
in the next section
i 'd like to
would like to thank
_SOS_ no it 's
_eqn_ and _eqn_ in
_SOS_ that would be
in the limit _eqn_
do n't know what
is given by the
_eqn_ and _eqn_ and
here to say this
_SOS_ i 'm sorry
_eqn_ _eqn_ _eqn_ _eqn_
i do n't get
the fact that the
_SOS_ i see what
let us consider the
i do n't even
the case of the
_SOS_ i 've never
in the presence of
_SOS_ i was thinking
_eqn_ in eq _EOS_
is _eqn_ where _eqn_
you did there _EOS_
do n't have to
given by _eqn_ where
in the previous section
it 's not a
_SOS_ to be fair
supported in part by
i do n't want
the right hand side
_SOS_ i wish i
_SOS_ this can be
_SOS_ i know i
the case of _eqn_
_SOS_ here _eqn_ is
_SOS_ if you 're
_SOS_ i 'm going
and _eqn_ respectively _EOS_
_SOS_ i want to
_SOS_ this is a
_SOS_ in particular the
i came here to
_SOS_ you 're right
it is possible to
_SOS_ i would n't
_SOS_ in the following
_eqn_ where _eqn_ are
_SOS_ it 's like
_eqn_ _eqn_ _eqn_ and
_SOS_ for _eqn_ the
that 's why i
and _eqn_ are the
do n't know why
by _eqn_ and _eqn_
the rest of the
_eqn_ such that _eqn_
all the time _EOS_
_SOS_ that 's why
_eqn_ in terms of
form _eqn_ where _eqn_
thank you so much
the form _eqn_ where
the same thing _EOS_
_SOS_ i have n't
the equation of motion
beat me to it
of the theory _EOS_
_SOS_ as a result
_SOS_ yeah it 's
_SOS_ me too _EOS_
in section _cite_ we
_eqn_ and _eqn_ the
i did n't even
_SOS_ i came here
_SOS_ we would like
_SOS_ it was a
_eqn_ we have _eqn_
is one of the
is related to the
_SOS_ do you have
_SOS_ where _eqn_ and
_eqn_ or _eqn_ _EOS_
like this __url__ _EOS_
i do n't understand
we see that the
_SOS_ it is easy
do n't have a
_SOS_ i used to
the other hand the
_SOS_ in section _cite_
thank you very much
_SOS_ you 're welcome
the form _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ oh my god
let _eqn_ be the
_SOS_ i was going
the form of the
_SOS_ yeah that 's
it is convenient to
between _eqn_ and _eqn_
do n't get it
_SOS_ not sure if
_eqn_ and _eqn_ for
_SOS_ in terms of
i do n't like
do n't think i
the large _eqn_ limit
at the same time
let _eqn_ be a
both _eqn_ and _eqn_
i 'll have to
_SOS_ i like the
_SOS_ it would be
here _eqn_ is the
if you want to
_SOS_ i have no
r h s _EOS_
_SOS_ i 'm just
the action of the
_SOS_ here you go
from _eqn_ to _eqn_
i wish i could
is given by _cite_
_SOS_ you 're a
we have _eqn_ _EOS_
_eqn_ and _eqn_ _eqn_
here you go __url__
are given by _eqn_
what do you mean
_SOS_ i 'm in
in section _cite_ _EOS_
_SOS_ i feel like
where _eqn_ is an
i can n't believe
it is clear that
_SOS_ do n't you
the r h s
_eqn_ with _eqn_ and
do n't know if
_SOS_ no that 's
in the following we
is organized as follows
not the only one
_eqn_ where we have
i think that 's
do n't know how
that _eqn_ is a
_SOS_ it can be
i 'm not a
_SOS_ in this way
_SOS_ it does n't
_SOS_ i 'm glad
_SOS_ note that _eqn_
one of the best
to _eqn_ and _eqn_
_cite_ where _eqn_ is
and i do n't
_SOS_ in particular we
i 'm not the
do n't think it
to the case of
_SOS_ in the present
i 'd love to
_SOS_ i was just
_eqn_ and _eqn_ we
it 's just a
turns out to be
_SOS_ you 're not
the presence of the
_SOS_ this implies that
one of my favorite
i think you 're
is given by _EOS_
_SOS_ what the fuck
given in _cite_ _EOS_
_SOS_ yeah i 'm
can be found in
a lot of people
expressed in terms of
_eqn_ and _eqn_ as
have an upvote _EOS_
_SOS_ what 's the
_cite_ _eqn_ where _eqn_
is easy to see
the end of the
it turns out that
nothing to do with
_SOS_ this is what
the value of _eqn_
i do n't really
we are interested in
_SOS_ i love you
_cite_ and _cite_ we
_SOS_ go on _EOS_
_SOS_ this work was
in the first place
organized as follows _EOS_
_SOS_ i live in
_SOS_ in fact the
_SOS_ i 've seen
and _eqn_ is a
for the case of
you go __url__ _EOS_
_SOS_ as long as
_eqn_ to _eqn_ _EOS_
paper is organized as
what i was thinking
_SOS_ i 'll be
_eqn_ _eqn_ _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ well that 's
be written as _eqn_
fields _eqn_ and _eqn_
you 're thinking of
_SOS_ it 's just
_SOS_ there is a
i 've never seen
of _eqn_ in the
_SOS_ why do you
right hand side of
_SOS_ one of the
you do n't know
_SOS_ i 'd like
degrees of freedom _EOS_
_SOS_ this is why
the structure of the
is the same as
it 's not like
do n't think you
the moduli space of
_SOS_ where _eqn_ _EOS_
you 're going to
as a function of
on the internet _EOS_
_SOS_ in the next
_SOS_ what are you
but i 'm not
easy to see that
_eqn_ so that _eqn_
at the end of
_SOS_ now let us
this is what i
_SOS_ i think they
it is well known
_SOS_ it is also
are you talking about
in the large _eqn_
you 're welcome _EOS_
the energy momentum tensor
was going to say
_SOS_ i thought that
we find that the
i had no idea
the fact that _eqn_
such that _eqn_ _EOS_
the shit out of
_SOS_ he 's a
_SOS_ it is not
_SOS_ i was n't
functions _eqn_ and _eqn_
_SOS_ if _eqn_ is
_SOS_ i know right
was supported in part
_SOS_ we see that
i have n't seen
equations of motion _EOS_
why do n't you
_SOS_ do n't be
is invariant under the
but i can n't
see e g _EOS_
i thought i was
this means that the
'm not the only
_eqn_ is a constant
as far as i
is as follows _EOS_
_eqn_ and _eqn_ where
have no idea what
_SOS_ that 's because
_eqn_ and _eqn_ with
_SOS_ so you 're
where _eqn_ are the
_eqn_ as _eqn_ _EOS_
i think it was
_SOS_ i thought the
_eqn_ for _eqn_ and
i would like to
in _eqn_ and _eqn_
_SOS_ i 'd say
the limit _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ there is no
it would be interesting
_eqn_ where _eqn_ _eqn_
the only one who
a function of _eqn_
do you have a
as well as the
thank you for the
_eqn_ is _eqn_ _EOS_
that 's what she
the only one _EOS_
would be interesting to
_SOS_ i 've heard
given by _cite_ _EOS_
i 've ever seen
the value of the
_SOS_ it turns out
so i do n't
i do n't care
where _eqn_ denotes the
_SOS_ i read that
_SOS_ let us first
_SOS_ it is a
i thought that was
i did n't think
shown in fig _EOS_
_SOS_ is n't that
on _eqn_ and _eqn_
came here to post
in this case we
do n't think that
this work was supported
the case of a
the first time i
_SOS_ you must be
it is straightforward to
_SOS_ i hope you
_eqn_ in _cite_ _EOS_
i just do n't
it is interesting to
_SOS_ i 'm guessing
can be obtained by
_SOS_ no i 'm
_SOS_ we note that
can n't tell if
in _cite_ and _cite_
_SOS_ i think this
the action of _eqn_
_SOS_ they do n't
operators _eqn_ and _eqn_
in part by the
in the middle of
_SOS_ it 's called
the existence of a
_SOS_ as a consequence
me to it _EOS_
in figure _cite_ _EOS_
_eqn_ of _eqn_ _EOS_
i would love to
i love you _EOS_
it is important to
_SOS_ it 's actually
_SOS_ it should be
_SOS_ i had to
in the same way
_SOS_ that 's just
given by eq _EOS_
can be written in
i was looking for
_SOS_ there are two
you do n't want
i think you mean
in the form _eqn_
do n't think so
that there is a
_SOS_ it 's all
is equivalent to the
_SOS_ i love the
the definition of the
_SOS_ me too i
_SOS_ the result is
_SOS_ i had a
_eqn_ are given by
_SOS_ acknowledgments acknowledgments unnumbered
_SOS_ i 've got
_SOS_ you are a
acknowledgments acknowledgments unnumbered _EOS_
_SOS_ if you have
the next section _EOS_
does not depend on
thought it was a
on the brane _EOS_
what she said _EOS_
_SOS_ _eqn_ and _eqn_
how do you know
the presence of a
is going to be
values of _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ thank you so
_eqn_ and _eqn_ which
_SOS_ i 'm so
can be used to
_SOS_ i could n't
the mass of the
's what she said
_SOS_ it is interesting
that 's exactly what
we have used the
i 've never heard
respect to _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ it is clear
_SOS_ yeah i was
can be obtained from
did n't know that
_SOS_ _cite_ can be
_SOS_ because it 's
_SOS_ as in the
_SOS_ i like to
_SOS_ it 's an
_eqn_ by _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ you have to
the next section we
_SOS_ acknowledgements acknowledgements unnumbered
_SOS_ i have to
_SOS_ a lot of
acknowledgements acknowledgements unnumbered _EOS_
and _eqn_ where _eqn_
i 'm trying to
_SOS_ this leads to
do n't know about
_eqn_ which is the
as long as you
as in _cite_ _EOS_
i did n't see
_SOS_ notice that the
_SOS_ what is this
_SOS_ have you ever
equations _cite_ and _cite_
_SOS_ however it is
_SOS_ you sir are
of this paper is
that 's a good
is well known that
you 're talking about
_SOS_ i think we
found in _cite_ _EOS_
_SOS_ as we have
_SOS_ i am a
_SOS_ i like how
the ads cft correspondence
_SOS_ since _eqn_ is
_SOS_ thank you very
_eqn_ corresponds to the
n't get it _EOS_
_eqn_ for all _eqn_
exactly what i was
i 'm in the
in this paper _EOS_
_SOS_ in the limit
i do n't remember
_SOS_ it is well
do n't even know
_SOS_ yes it is
as _eqn_ and _eqn_
_eqn_ in _eqn_ _EOS_
do n't forget the
_SOS_ i guess i
proportional to _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ first of all
_SOS_ if you do
_SOS_ for _eqn_ we
in the world _EOS_
_SOS_ for example the
_SOS_ that is a
_SOS_ not to mention
_SOS_ would like to
one of the most
the existence of the
_SOS_ my thoughts exactly
are _eqn_ and _eqn_
i wish i had
with the help of
_SOS_ we consider the
you 're right i
_eqn_ is defined by
it 's not that
_eqn_ _eqn_ where _eqn_
i do n't believe
_SOS_ but it 's
_eqn_ where _eqn_ denotes
and _eqn_ for _eqn_
i thought you were
_SOS_ i 've always
to the fact that
_SOS_ for simplicity we
_SOS_ why would you
is due to the
this is why i
_SOS_ sounds like a
value of _eqn_ _EOS_
_eqn_ and _eqn_ have
do n't you mean
that 's not a
this section we will
_SOS_ due to the
_SOS_ well i 'm
_SOS_ i 'd be
_SOS_ we find that
and _eqn_ and _eqn_
to say this _EOS_
_SOS_ the paper is
the first place _EOS_
of the black hole
to do with the
_SOS_ is that a
that _eqn_ where _eqn_
_SOS_ that does n't
_eqn_ with respect to
_SOS_ i would have
_cite_ and _cite_ are
in the limit of
you do n't need
_SOS_ and that 's
at _eqn_ and _eqn_
for the first time
the construction of the
i think he 's
in this case _eqn_
_SOS_ in what follows
what 's wrong with
_SOS_ _eqn_ is the
i can n't wait
_SOS_ it looks like
in such a way
_SOS_ i agree with
and _eqn_ in the
for all _eqn_ _EOS_
you 're right _EOS_
i think i 'm
the point of view
we have _eqn_ and
you very much _EOS_
_SOS_ in the _eqn_
thanks for the link
_SOS_ that was my
discussed in _cite_ _EOS_
is determined by the
you know what i
it 's not the
the previous section _EOS_
it 's one of
of order _eqn_ _EOS_
_eqn_ and _eqn_ can
for some reason _EOS_
in other words the
it 's a good
_SOS_ that was the
in the _eqn_ case
_SOS_ he did n't
_SOS_ the work of
_SOS_ i love that
it follows that _eqn_
i 'm sorry i
that there is no
_SOS_ only if you
equations of motion for
_SOS_ i wonder if
a consequence of the
_SOS_ _cite_ where the
when it comes to
but it 's not
point of view of
of the gauge group
the same time _EOS_
_SOS_ it follows that
do n't need to
_SOS_ frac _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ it 's been
_SOS_ reminds me of
in terms of a
_SOS_ i am not
_SOS_ that 's how
in the absence of
_eqn_ on _eqn_ _EOS_
going to have to
check it out _EOS_
it is natural to
have to do with
is proportional to _eqn_
_SOS_ i have the
_SOS_ the fact that
_SOS_ why thank you
in what follows we
_SOS_ this is true
_eqn_ and the _eqn_
i feel like i
where we have used
in the framework of
_SOS_ i 'm gonna
can be interpreted as
_SOS_ in our case
to be able to
for some reason i
from the point of
_SOS_ he 's not
_SOS_ this is because
written in terms of
you beat me to
_SOS_ _cite_ with _eqn_
_SOS_ same here _EOS_
_SOS_ i 'll take
the case _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ you did n't
in this case _EOS_
_SOS_ there 's no
we have _eqn_ where
_SOS_ no you 're
takes the form _eqn_
_SOS_ in this appendix
you so much _EOS_
the explicit form of
this one __url__ _EOS_
_SOS_ it 's okay
_eqn_ is an arbitrary
i was trying to
quantum field theory _EOS_
_SOS_ how did you
_SOS_ note that in
_SOS_ you need to
the calculation of the
_SOS_ for some reason
this paper we have
_SOS_ why are you
_eqn_ in the _eqn_
_SOS_ i second this
of the moduli space
_SOS_ what the hell
in this appendix we
_SOS_ it has been
did n't want to
_eqn_ is the _eqn_
i 'm sure you
_SOS_ do you know
parameters _eqn_ and _eqn_
_SOS_ thanks i 'll
_eqn_ and _eqn_ to
_SOS_ this is not
_SOS_ is there a
is proportional to the
_SOS_ why do n't
the solution of the
_eqn_ so that the
i 'm glad i
_SOS_ same here i
_eqn_ can be written
_SOS_ what kind of
be found in _cite_
's one of the
the paper is organized
it 's hard to
the relation between the
i 'm glad you
the function _eqn_ is
_SOS_ _cite_ and the
_SOS_ it 's ok
_SOS_ if it 's
_SOS_ in _cite_ the
's what i was
_SOS_ it is important
i still do n't
we are going to
_SOS_ thus we have
the first thing i
_SOS_ one of my
as we will see
as a consequence of
i know it 's
i 've got a
is consistent with the
_SOS_ i know it
_SOS_ the action of
can n't wait to
of _eqn_ can be
as soon as i
from _cite_ and _cite_
that 's how i
the spectrum of the
_SOS_ that 's exactly
of the operator _eqn_
_SOS_ i read this
of _eqn_ and the
_SOS_ it is convenient
no it 's not
i think this is
we have shown that
_SOS_ this is n't
so that _eqn_ _EOS_
do n't think he
the size of the
_SOS_ no problem _EOS_
and _eqn_ can be
_SOS_ that is the
equal to _eqn_ _EOS_
in the present paper
they do n't have
_SOS_ well it 's
is defined by _eqn_
it is necessary to
that i do n't
_SOS_ _cite_ in the
i was about to
_SOS_ the equations of
has nothing to do
_SOS_ it was n't
of _eqn_ is _eqn_
i did n't realize
this paper we will
is one of my
we will show that
it would be a
we note that the
_cite_ we see that
think it 's a
i really do n't
we find that _eqn_
_SOS_ here 's a
is based on the
we see that _eqn_
you do n't like
i just want to
work was supported in
_eqn_ as well as
do you have any
i was thinking the
we show that the
if _eqn_ and _eqn_
this is one of
_SOS_ i 'd rather
in table _cite_ _EOS_
can n't explain that
given by _eqn_ and
_SOS_ i like this
_SOS_ i know that
the first term in
i love it _EOS_
on the right hand
if you can n't
this implies that the
_SOS_ i agree i
in the case _eqn_
_SOS_ are you sure
values of _eqn_ and
in order to obtain
you do n't get
_SOS_ that 's pretty
_eqn_ at _eqn_ _EOS_
it 's the only
of the form _cite_
_SOS_ according to the
n't know how to
_SOS_ if you can
the origin of the
it is useful to
was the only one
_SOS_ fair enough _EOS_
the low energy effective
when i was a
where _eqn_ _eqn_ and
in the form of
that would be a
_SOS_ we do n't
the properties of the
_SOS_ i believe it
let us now consider
_SOS_ let us start
__url__ __url__ __url__ __url__
thanks for the tip
the analysis of the
i can confirm this
yang mills theory _EOS_
_SOS_ the existence of
this is the first
_SOS_ not at all
_SOS_ we show that
_SOS_ i would like
is independent of the
if you 're a
not depend on the
n't explain that _EOS_
of the effective action
_SOS_ i thought you
if and only if
_SOS_ yeah i know
to show that the
_SOS_ you know what
representation of _eqn_ _EOS_
a bit of a
of motion for the
_SOS_ this is my
_SOS_ to this end
i 'm sure it
such a way that
_SOS_ i always thought
_SOS_ we can now
i like it _EOS_
the same as the
_SOS_ we will see
do n't know i
_SOS_ are you a
in _eqn_ dimensions _EOS_
here _eqn_ and _eqn_
it 's like a
_SOS_ at this point
_SOS_ that was a
for the rest of
function of _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ do n't know
equation of motion for
_SOS_ what is the
is of the form
_SOS_ in that case
_eqn_ is defined as
_SOS_ no but i
the two point function
it 's in the
the role of the
do n't have any
we will see that
_SOS_ exactly what i
_SOS_ note that this
_SOS_ i thought i
that _eqn_ is the
_eqn_ and _eqn_ of
i was thinking of
is n't it _EOS_
_SOS_ i do not
can be rewritten as
here to post this
the same as in
_SOS_ i love how
for _eqn_ we have
it 's going to
of the gauge field
be thought of as
i think it is
i can n't find
in the following way
_SOS_ i was hoping
note that _eqn_ is
has the form _eqn_
it 's the same
_SOS_ we do not
thinking the same thing
be expressed in terms
first thing i thought
_SOS_ yeah i think
_SOS_ i did not
in addition to the
i can n't even
point of view _EOS_
_SOS_ we use the
something like that _EOS_
from the fact that
i can n't tell
_SOS_ if you want
the dynamics of the
i was the only
the choice of the
_SOS_ i like your
the context of the
_SOS_ if you are
and _eqn_ with _eqn_
is described by the
thank you sir _EOS_
_SOS_ oh god i
is equal to _eqn_
_SOS_ as an example
was going to be
i am going to
the dimension of the
_SOS_ i 'm still
_SOS_ the purpose of
_SOS_ it 's also
_SOS_ this is in
's going to be
have _eqn_ where _eqn_
_SOS_ not if you
_eqn_ we obtain the
_SOS_ i 've had
as a result the
_SOS_ where do you
to be _eqn_ _EOS_
'm not sure if
given in eq _EOS_
at the time _EOS_
the _eqn_ case _EOS_
've never heard of
_SOS_ it is the
a function of the
do n't worry i
_SOS_ to see this
something to do with
_SOS_ good to know
we assume that the
_SOS_ have you seen
one can show that
independent of _eqn_ _EOS_
no i do n't
_SOS_ in this sense
_SOS_ wow that 's
_SOS_ the function _eqn_
i guess it 's
_SOS_ you have a
the left hand side
's exactly what i
the components of the
_SOS_ i 'm on
_SOS_ the number of
_SOS_ in this limit
_SOS_ it 's funny
_SOS_ as we will
what the fuck _EOS_
glad i 'm not
turn out to be
_eqn_ corresponding to the
the exact same thing
_SOS_ for the case
what the fuck is
_SOS_ i 'm from
now turn to the
_eqn_ we obtain _eqn_
i 've seen it
to _eqn_ where _eqn_
was one of the
i want to see
in this way we
_SOS_ we start with
you sir are a
'm pretty sure that
the contribution of the
_SOS_ is n't it
denote by _eqn_ the
_eqn_ is related to
say the same thing
this is not the
you can n't explain
as we shall see
i would n't be
_SOS_ where we have
that 's the one
_SOS_ i was wondering
_eqn_ in order to
_SOS_ i would say
_SOS_ it will be
are related to the
we do n't have
but it 's a
the second term in
'm pretty sure it
_eqn_ which can be
_SOS_ i agree _EOS_
in the bulk _EOS_
in the low energy
you might want to
_SOS_ this made me
can be regarded as
_SOS_ well if you
in the _eqn_ direction
and i 'm not
the variation of the
_SOS_ i love this
the expression for the
is independent of _eqn_
you 're doing it
_SOS_ in general the
can n't believe i
_SOS_ i would love
of the model _EOS_
's what i thought
if _eqn_ is a
_SOS_ yes it 's
action of _eqn_ on
_SOS_ you are correct
of the _eqn_ theory
of _eqn_ on _eqn_
reddit enhancement suite __url__
_SOS_ thank you sir
are given by the
i did n't say
by means of the
do n't know _EOS_
_SOS_ i 'm and
is supported in part
_SOS_ it was the
be written in the
_SOS_ holy shit i
an infinite number of
know what i mean
the purpose of this
_SOS_ thanks i 'm
let us consider a
_SOS_ we assume that
in the us _EOS_
i 'm talking about
it can be shown
the behavior of the
what i mean _EOS_
_SOS_ it is straightforward
as much as i
_SOS_ i can confirm
_SOS_ this paper is
_SOS_ i 'd love
_eqn_ is a _eqn_
can be expressed in
n't think it 's
_SOS_ it 's more
the definition of _eqn_
do n't have the
in powers of _eqn_
defined by _eqn_ _EOS_
if you have n't
_SOS_ in fact we
have a lot of
_SOS_ we will show
i 'm not going
_SOS_ i lol 'd
paper is as follows
_SOS_ i 'll just
the energy of the
_SOS_ yeah i do
as in the case
we obtain _eqn_ _EOS_
what do you think
i did n't have
terms of _eqn_ and
of _eqn_ on the
yes it is _EOS_
if you have a
w r t _EOS_
i agree with you
in agreement with the
_SOS_ what 's your
the effect of the
_SOS_ i have never
in the appendix _EOS_
as long as it
in four dimensions _EOS_
_SOS_ no no no
in the sense that
it 's kind of
without loss of generality
_SOS_ at least you
_SOS_ this corresponds to
for a while _EOS_
to see that the
_SOS_ i bet you
we obtain the following
this is the best
written as _eqn_ where
anti de sitter space
was thinking the same
_SOS_ actually it 's
_SOS_ we have also
_SOS_ where _eqn_ are
the rest of us
can be viewed as
that 's not the
_SOS_ this will be
i think i 'll
be obtained from the
it 's a great
_SOS_ for the _eqn_
_SOS_ there was a
_SOS_ _eqn_ where _eqn_
n't be able to
_SOS_ for this reason
_SOS_ what about the
n't have to be
the sum of the
_SOS_ in the previous
you do n't mind
be identified with the
i just can n't
that 's what you
the functions _eqn_ and
but i did n't
the operator _eqn_ is
_SOS_ we will now
one of the few
_SOS_ in addition to
i read that as
i just wanted to
the radius of the
for the heads up
for useful discussions _EOS_
_cite_ with _eqn_ _EOS_
if you 're not
_SOS_ you mean the
the vanishing of the
_SOS_ he does n't
it follows that the
_SOS_ the presence of
if you know what
_eqn_ instead of _eqn_
i thought he was
_SOS_ i read it
_SOS_ when _eqn_ the
_SOS_ it 's true
in string theory _EOS_
_SOS_ how can you
_SOS_ it is possible
most of the time
of the system _EOS_
_SOS_ for this purpose
_SOS_ yes that 's
'm not sure what
here _eqn_ is a
doing it wrong _EOS_
it is known that
_eqn_ we see that
to say the same
given in terms of
it was a joke
_SOS_ i guess you
of the field _eqn_
_SOS_ if _eqn_ then
_SOS_ that 's my
_SOS_ it 's pretty
the following we will
_eqn_ where the _eqn_
you 're looking for
_SOS_ at first i
the values of _eqn_
_SOS_ looks like a
the gauge group is
_SOS_ this work is
thought the same thing
_SOS_ i 'm with
consider the case of
in contrast to the
pretty sure it 's
_SOS_ it 's in
of the scalar field
that 's not what
we now turn to
's what i 'm
can be identified with
_SOS_ we now turn
i was referring to
_SOS_ good point _EOS_
denoted by _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ we have _eqn_
my thoughts exactly _EOS_
_SOS_ i like that
_SOS_ note also that
can be considered as
i did n't get
is not difficult to
yeah i do n't
but it does n't
of _eqn_ with _eqn_
_SOS_ i need to
_SOS_ of course the
the form _cite_ _EOS_
to do that _EOS_
is the number of
thanks for the info
_SOS_ we now consider
in my head _EOS_
_SOS_ in _cite_ we
_SOS_ that 's actually
_SOS_ can n't tell
_SOS_ in the first
_SOS_ it 's from
_SOS_ it follows from
thanks for the heads
the operators _eqn_ and
can be expressed as
makes me want to
i 'll give you
is a consequence of
_eqn_ super yang mills
are you going to
_cite_ where _eqn_ and
i think he was
i have n't been
the volume of the
of _cite_ and _cite_
the name of the
_SOS_ in _cite_ it
_SOS_ which is why
i 'm with you
in the _eqn_ limit
_SOS_ please do n't
the gauge group _eqn_
_SOS_ the second term
is exactly what i
_SOS_ in particular it
_SOS_ welcome to the
_SOS_ beat me to
_SOS_ it is worth
i 'm not even
a solution of the
have no idea how
_SOS_ no it was
derivative with respect to
the same way as
to do it _EOS_
defined in _cite_ _EOS_
i can n't remember
i know i 'm
it is not difficult
_SOS_ what 's wrong
_eqn_ we get _eqn_
going to be a
we denote by _eqn_
_SOS_ _cite_ for the
far as i know
a hell of a
we will consider the
it was shown that
that 's why you
'm not going to
_eqn_ with _eqn_ the
_SOS_ oh man i
is defined by the
_SOS_ here __url__ _EOS_
_SOS_ we want to
_SOS_ maybe it 's
is similar to the
_eqn_ and _eqn_ by
n't want to be
by _eqn_ with _eqn_
here to say that
_SOS_ here we have
_SOS_ it 's still
_SOS_ we are interested
i 'm looking for
_SOS_ and my axe
_cite_ in terms of
i was talking about
in this subsection we
_SOS_ it 's so
in the adjoint representation
_SOS_ partial _eqn_ _EOS_
you have no idea
order in _eqn_ _EOS_
thought i was the
all of them _EOS_
this is the case
_SOS_ in this subsection
but when i do
_SOS_ if i had
we conclude that the
_SOS_ and it 's
are interested in the
taking into account the
the hell out of
of this __url__ _EOS_
term in eq _EOS_
_SOS_ these are the
it 's been a
is clear that the
it did n't happen
_SOS_ ah i see
_eqn_ which is a
is the following _EOS_
of all time _EOS_
_eqn_ here _eqn_ is
never heard of it
_SOS_ depends on the
in appendix _cite_ _EOS_
_SOS_ right _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ well played _EOS_
_SOS_ now that 's
of the function _eqn_
on the r h
which is why i
_SOS_ i 'm thinking
expectation value of the
i thought the same
large _eqn_ limit _EOS_
_SOS_ thanks a lot
powers of _eqn_ _EOS_
in the present case
this is the only
_cite_ we obtain the
do n't give a
_SOS_ this is an
that 's the only
do n't forget to
we will use the
i know what you
of the _eqn_ and
it is given by
that 's the joke
i can think of
of _eqn_ _eqn_ and
_SOS_ that 's an
at the level of
_SOS_ i can see
equations of motion are
_SOS_ i like it
_SOS_ where _eqn_ _eqn_
_SOS_ we can also
i 'll let you
thank you for your
we start with the
or something like that
side of eq _EOS_
did n't even know
due to the fact
do n't see how
is defined as _eqn_
_SOS_ upvote for the
_eqn_ can be obtained
gauge group _eqn_ _EOS_
that would be the
_SOS_ the first term
for a long time
explicit form of the
_SOS_ we are now
it was just a
_SOS_ here we will
do n't think the
_SOS_ yeah i 've
variables _eqn_ and _eqn_
_SOS_ no this is
this paper is to
of this paper _EOS_
shut the fuck up
_SOS_ however in the
_SOS_ i 'll have
_SOS_ that 's it
it has been shown
like a boss _EOS_
the computation of the
_SOS_ do you think
it is sufficient to
hand side of eq
i 'll check it
and _eqn_ _eqn_ _EOS_
do n't know the
_SOS_ i believe the
this leads to the
do n't think they
in the last section
_SOS_ in addition the
what the hell is
i guess i 'm
in the _eqn_ plane
'd like to see
be written as _EOS_
as in the previous
back in the day
_SOS_ because of the
it 's all about
it 's not _EOS_
the fields _eqn_ and
_SOS_ taking into account
i thought this was
_SOS_ i was gonna
the evolution of the
have _eqn_ and _eqn_
that 's what the
a few years ago
to the presence of
at the moment _EOS_
this paper is organized
_cite_ is given by
was supposed to be
_SOS_ so far we
can n't wait for
'm going to have
_SOS_ the reason is
hand side of _cite_
you good sir _EOS_
i 'm sure he
let _eqn_ and _eqn_
section is devoted to
that 's the point
_SOS_ in addition we
it does n't matter
_SOS_ yeah it was
is not the case
at the quantum level
the only way to
by the way _EOS_
for the sake of
_SOS_ i believe you
of the energy momentum
_SOS_ please tell me
the expectation value of
_SOS_ you know i
i e _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ in the above
does n't seem to
are _eqn_ where _eqn_
in this thread _EOS_
_SOS_ for _eqn_ _eqn_
_SOS_ tell that to
do n't like it
we assume that _eqn_
let me know if
of _eqn_ in _eqn_
i 'm not your
of _eqn_ _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ we have shown
because i do n't
is a function of
it looks like a
_SOS_ from what i
the k hler potential
i want to know
is easy to check
_SOS_ now we can
'll check it out
super yang mills theory
one of my favorites
we have seen that
_SOS_ it is therefore
a lot of the
_SOS_ _eqn_ is a
i was a kid
_cite_ we obtain _eqn_
it 's all good
_SOS_ at the same
and my axe _EOS_
_SOS_ i 'm actually
the previous section we
_SOS_ i love it
are the same as
_SOS_ no i do
_SOS_ we conclude that
_eqn_ is equal to
i did n't want
_SOS_ no problem i
one can see that
the expression for _eqn_
upvote for you _EOS_
_SOS_ i know but
_cite_ i e _EOS_
_SOS_ here _eqn_ and
_SOS_ it 's only
's a lot of
_SOS_ it is known
_SOS_ what 's a
the partition function of
i can n't imagine
since _eqn_ and _eqn_
are given by _EOS_
that does n't mean
of my life _EOS_
where _eqn_ is given
_SOS_ are you saying
_SOS_ from _cite_ we
_SOS_ we begin with
i did not know
_SOS_ i know what
for any _eqn_ _EOS_
let us first consider
this guy __url__ _EOS_
_eqn_ _eqn_ is the
i 've never been
'm not sure i
_SOS_ _cite_ it is
did n't even notice
either _eqn_ or _eqn_
_eqn_ is the number
it 's more like
_eqn_ is invariant under
i was gonna say
i 'm not really
it is not clear
_SOS_ well at least
of _eqn_ i e
_SOS_ so that 's
the position of the
i 'd have to
this can be done
_eqn_ _eqn_ and the
it would have been
_SOS_ let us denote
am i the only
the only one that
we get _eqn_ _EOS_
i thought they were
is equal to the
of motion for _eqn_
the fuck out of
_SOS_ yes yes it
case of _eqn_ _EOS_
not depend on _eqn_
why do you think
__url__ __url__ __url__ _EOS_
of the paper is
i 've never had
the generators of the
of degrees of freedom
there are a lot
of the gauge theory
there 's no way
_SOS_ as for the
i do n't _EOS_
an important role in
to do with it
_SOS_ you would n't
is _eqn_ and the
_SOS_ then we have
t i o n
a good idea _EOS_
the gauge field _eqn_
_cite_ and references therein
out of it _EOS_
'd love to see
_SOS_ it is then
_SOS_ for example in
it 's a pretty
_SOS_ to be honest
it is shown that
_SOS_ thus we can
for the link _EOS_
did n't happen _EOS_
_SOS_ does n't matter
of the previous section
_SOS_ as far as
in the sense of
_SOS_ no it is
_eqn_ and _eqn_ _cite_
i 'm sorry _EOS_
the _eqn_ dependence of
in the future _EOS_
see also _cite_ _EOS_
i do n't mind
the nature of the
what 's going on
written in the form
as we have seen
that does n't make
_SOS_ we define the
i the only one
_eqn_ there is a
can confirm this _EOS_
is that you _EOS_
the _eqn_ direction _EOS_
_SOS_ that 's true
of _eqn_ _cite_ _EOS_
in _cite_ it was
know what you 're
_ix_ and _ix_ _EOS_
that you do n't
_SOS_ _cite_ we have
_SOS_ i believe that
of the standard model
should be able to
gives rise to a
i can n't help
_SOS_ it 's my
_SOS_ we will consider
_SOS_ it 's on
a finite number of
i o n _EOS_
us now consider the
i was n't sure
of the form _EOS_
_SOS_ thanks for that
_SOS_ the parameter _eqn_
_SOS_ i thought he
_eqn_ of the _eqn_
do n't understand why
terms of _eqn_ _EOS_
at the end _EOS_
the gauge group _EOS_
_SOS_ i got a
can be shown that
the results of _cite_
what are you talking
_eqn_ and _eqn_ be
now i have to
_eqn_ is proportional to
on the front page
i think it would
the expansion of the
i hope you 're
of the equations of
_cite_ where _eqn_ _EOS_
but that does n't
_SOS_ i never said
_SOS_ the case of
that there are no
what you 're saying
are a lot of
for the case _eqn_
_SOS_ i have been
_SOS_ in this work
_SOS_ as discussed in
_SOS_ do you mean
_SOS_ have you tried
_SOS_ in view of
in this limit the
of the time _EOS_
_SOS_ why not _EOS_
relation between _eqn_ and
_SOS_ i 'm the
in order to have
_cite_ and _cite_ the
but i think it
_SOS_ challenge accepted _EOS_
_SOS_ in such a
_SOS_ _ix_ and _ix_
_SOS_ that sounds like
degrees of freedom of
does n't make it
_SOS_ note that we
in my opinion _EOS_
_SOS_ i 'm an
easy to check that
_SOS_ sounds like you
when _eqn_ and _eqn_
_SOS_ this is how
at the classical level
note that in the
was my first thought
know what you mean
the solutions of the
_SOS_ i think its
conformal field theory _EOS_
_SOS_ when i was
can be extended to
in the background of
that would be awesome
respect to _eqn_ and
we 're talking about
the eigenvalues of the
think it would be
_SOS_ in fact this
_SOS_ she 's a
if it 's a
studied in _cite_ _EOS_
_SOS_ like this __url__
we have the following
_SOS_ i still do
_SOS_ the operator _eqn_
_SOS_ it 's really
we obtain _eqn_ where
_cite_ we find that
what you 're talking
it would n't be
the present paper we
_cite_ can be written
does n't have a
_SOS_ i am so
_SOS_ one can also
low energy effective action
to be honest i
_SOS_ no need to
is nothing but the
_SOS_ in fact it
to say that _EOS_
the bottom of the
to this end we
_SOS_ i like you
of the _eqn_ field
_SOS_ it 's because
we are able to
in the following _EOS_
you 'd have to
_SOS_ in the second
does n't have to
coordinates _eqn_ and _eqn_
i would n't have
people who do n't
plays the role of
_SOS_ so it 's
matrices _eqn_ and _eqn_
_eqn_ as a function
i like to think
_SOS_ i was about
the following way _EOS_
be considered as a
it for me _EOS_
on the boundary _EOS_
would love to see
i do n't need
the degrees of freedom
_SOS_ this shows that
i read that in
do n't know but
of the fact that
_SOS_ that 's awesome
this can be seen
_SOS_ therefore it is
along the lines of
are given by _cite_
it 's not just
for _eqn_ _eqn_ and
he 's going to
of the four dimensional
you have to be
glad i could help
it should be noted
_SOS_ we will use
i think i 've
_SOS_ oh yeah i
and _eqn_ for the
i have a feeling
the boundary of the
i 'm not saying
so far we have
turns out that the
was the first thing
_SOS_ i find it
there is only one
_SOS_ this __url__ is
let us start with
as a result of
made my day _EOS_
at least it 's
in the general case
_SOS_ it was shown
it does n't work
do you mean _EOS_
in this work we
_SOS_ yeah but i
as in eq _EOS_
_SOS_ end aligned _eqn_
can n't think of
_SOS_ as we shall
you 're in the
for you __url__ _EOS_
in a similar way
_SOS_ i do this
we can write _eqn_
_SOS_ i just got
is a constant _EOS_
_SOS_ i tried to
_SOS_ when _eqn_ is
_SOS_ i thought this
_SOS_ we have seen
are you trying to
the sign of the
've ever seen _EOS_
which corresponds to the
and i can n't
making use of the
_SOS_ how so _EOS_
the _eqn_ theory _EOS_
_SOS_ i see you
as follows _eqn_ where
can be thought of
do you want to
the form _eqn_ with
when i get home
so you 're saying
the derivation of the
de sitter space _EOS_
or it did n't
a linear combination of
it 's funny because
_SOS_ let _eqn_ and
that 's all i
're doing it wrong
considered in _cite_ _EOS_
if _eqn_ then _eqn_
n't the only one
he 's talking about
the study of the
_SOS_ no i think
_eqn_ we find that
i 'm sure they
in _cite_ for the
_SOS_ you 're the
the values of the
_SOS_ no he 's
under the action of
_SOS_ what did you
_eqn_ which corresponds to
_eqn_ has to be
trying to figure out
ads cft correspondence _EOS_
i lol 'd _EOS_
_SOS_ every time i
of the _eqn_ _EOS_
i was n't the
one to one correspondence
by _eqn_ and the
i know i was
_SOS_ the latter is
i 've seen this
in the definition of
that 's one of
that 's why it
_eqn_ is equivalent to
thank you for that
is supposed to be
we arrive at the
_SOS_ the equation of
and i did n't
_SOS_ _cite_ with the
do n't be a
i was hoping for
written as _eqn_ _EOS_
in quantum field theory
thank you for this
in a while _EOS_
of the action _cite_
_SOS_ in the same
_SOS_ that 's like
the following form _eqn_
you 're trying to
_SOS_ it is n't
the action _cite_ is
_SOS_ i can only
we are left with
_eqn_ is independent of
i can n't get
_SOS_ in the last
a long time ago
as _eqn_ with _eqn_
does n't look like
_SOS_ well i guess
the results of the
_SOS_ they 're not
the geometry of the
_SOS_ the set of
a long time _EOS_
_eqn_ is given in
thing i thought of
_SOS_ oh that 's
the use of the
of the _eqn_ s
thanks so much _EOS_
_eqn_ in _cite_ is
was just about to
the operator _eqn_ _EOS_
this is exactly what
so i 'm not
was supported by the
_SOS_ i guess it
on the choice of
_SOS_ just do n't
terms of the _eqn_
_eqn_ we find _eqn_
the top of the
_SOS_ how is it
work was supported by
i guess that 's
of the order of
could n't agree more
of _eqn_ which is
_eqn_ and _eqn_ on
that 's a pretty
_SOS_ it 's probably
_cite_ we have _eqn_
_SOS_ for science _EOS_
the scalar field _eqn_
_SOS_ of course it
will be discussed in
_SOS_ i agree but
the conformal field theory
thank you good sir
the l h s
_SOS_ as someone who
_SOS_ the aim of
is given by a
thanks a lot _EOS_
_SOS_ here 's the
we can use the
_SOS_ at least it
the moduli space _EOS_
_SOS_ this is exactly
as a consequence the
do n't worry about
of the present paper
_SOS_ however there is
_SOS_ this __url__ _EOS_
_SOS_ where did you
the coupling constant _eqn_
_SOS_ awesome thanks _EOS_
in this way the
in _cite_ can be
it 's true _EOS_
_SOS_ i went to
the trace of the
_SOS_ i 'm surprised
of string theory _EOS_
would you like to
_SOS_ are you kidding
the details of the
in the theory _EOS_
n't give a shit
gives rise to the
it is __url__ _EOS_
_SOS_ then we can
one of them _EOS_
_SOS_ in particular _eqn_
_SOS_ yeah that was
_SOS_ is that the
in the space of
of _eqn_ in _cite_
what 's the difference
're talking about _EOS_
the order of the
_SOS_ you mean like
to each other _EOS_
we consider the case
where do you live
_SOS_ oh i 'm
is of order _eqn_
_SOS_ for _eqn_ and
the best way to
have n't seen it
the adjoint representation of
l h s _EOS_
you do n't even
_SOS_ there are several
first time i 've
i do n't always
we do not have
_eqn_ if _eqn_ _EOS_
the other way around
_SOS_ you 'd be
depend on _eqn_ _EOS_
n't think that 's
type iib string theory
_SOS_ yes this is
of the type _eqn_
_SOS_ this kills the
solution of eq _EOS_
_SOS_ yeah but it
a generalization of the
_SOS_ how do i
_SOS_ this result is
_SOS_ unless you 're
the limit _eqn_ the
_SOS_ _cite_ for _eqn_
not so much _EOS_
a bad thing _EOS_
the effective action _EOS_
_SOS_ we need to
let _eqn_ denote the
do n't get the
in the fundamental representation
_SOS_ citation needed _EOS_
be written in terms
that 's what he
this corresponds to the
_SOS_ my first thought
can be described by
_cite_ is invariant under
son of a bitch
coefficients _eqn_ and _eqn_
what i was looking
for you sir _EOS_
the total number of
_cite_ see also _cite_
n't think i 've
but thanks for the
value of _eqn_ is
_SOS_ and if you
the low energy limit
_SOS_ i really like
of the cosmological constant
for _eqn_ _eqn_ _EOS_
it 's a bit
_SOS_ i would be
_SOS_ since we are
_SOS_ will do _EOS_
shown in figure _cite_
_SOS_ i am the
_SOS_ we will also
the other hand we
there are plenty of
_SOS_ i guess that
_eqn_ is determined by
_SOS_ it is now
was n't the only
in the region _eqn_
constants _eqn_ and _eqn_
pretty sure that 's
'll let you know
can be seen from
_eqn_ is not a
i really want to
it 's not really
the framework of the
as is well known
i 'll just leave
_SOS_ for example _eqn_
_SOS_ thanks so much
_SOS_ he 's the
this is due to
from now on we
i can n't stop
as follows _eqn_ _EOS_
n't know why you
given by _eqn_ the
let me know _EOS_
_SOS_ let _eqn_ denote
a little bit of
_SOS_ haha that 's
and references therein _EOS_
the same form as
when i saw the
_SOS_ oh come on
the last term in
_SOS_ and this is
where _eqn_ and the
and _eqn_ are given
if it 's not
_SOS_ first thing i
the light cone gauge
_cite_ with _eqn_ and
i think you are
what you mean _EOS_
where _eqn_ is defined
creation and annihilation operators
what i was going
i 'll be in
on the moduli space
good to know _EOS_
in the form _cite_
_SOS_ i 'm trying
the contribution from the
_SOS_ you are not
_cite_ for _eqn_ _EOS_
be interpreted as a
i have to say
can be derived from
this is true _EOS_
_SOS_ you 're thinking
in this case is
made me laugh _EOS_
we now consider the
on this one _EOS_
the function _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ you have no
_eqn_ is _eqn_ where
_eqn_ is a function
supposed to be a
i was thinking _EOS_
the sign of _eqn_
_SOS_ however this is
_SOS_ you should have
_SOS_ i concur _EOS_
this implies that _eqn_
for the _eqn_ case
i would n't say
_eqn_ stands for the
i 'm so glad
_eqn_ depends on the
it 's supposed to
_SOS_ i 'll give
the _eqn_ s are
of the year _EOS_
theory on _eqn_ _EOS_
equations of motion _cite_
i 'd say it
_SOS_ in this letter
i think that was
_SOS_ the action _cite_
i 'm sure there
_SOS_ the action is
exactly what i thought
corresponds to _eqn_ _EOS_
i can confirm that
_SOS_ but that 's
we can see that
assume that _eqn_ is
i did n't mean
at the origin _EOS_
do you mean by
_SOS_ it remains to
_SOS_ yes i am
_SOS_ i just want
in the literature _EOS_
to that of the
would be awesome _EOS_
directed by m night
the parameter _eqn_ is
defined in eq _EOS_
you 're right it
_SOS_ in both cases
i 'm sure that
_SOS_ i 'll try
the chern simons term
all the things _EOS_
not contribute to the
_SOS_ how dare you
the left and right
_SOS_ thus it is
the middle of the
_SOS_ i 'm afraid
in the moduli space
_SOS_ _cite_ we obtain
the front page _EOS_
i 'll try to
the behaviour of the
for the tip _EOS_
points _eqn_ and _eqn_
_SOS_ this is one
_eqn_ we have the
_eqn_ is the same
has to do with
it was n't a
the action _cite_ _EOS_
all the way down
section we discuss the
'm pretty sure i
where _eqn_ _eqn_ _eqn_
do n't see the
should be noted that
_SOS_ then _eqn_ is
you just have to
_SOS_ how is that
the matrix _eqn_ is
i guess i 'll
in view of the
be related to the
if you did n't
and only if _eqn_
if you ask me
_SOS_ recall that the
i want to be
over _eqn_ and _eqn_
you can n't get
given by _eqn_ with
no such thing as
_SOS_ to obtain the
think it 's the
do n't even have
well known that the
_SOS_ well it is
is in agreement with
of the group _eqn_
that it 's not
_SOS_ the moduli space
if it was n't
taken into account _EOS_
the only one i
function of _eqn_ and
that was my first
_SOS_ i had no
the location of the
be interpreted as the
well i do n't
_SOS_ i 'm really
let us assume that
_SOS_ psi _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ you 've got
the reason is that
you 'll have to
_SOS_ the structure of
thank you kind sir
it 's just the
this work is supported
_SOS_ _cite_ and _eqn_
in the morning _EOS_
in other words we
the only reason i
_SOS_ i second that
as can be seen
_SOS_ as shown in
what do you do
anything to do with
the field _eqn_ _EOS_
but it 's still
is devoted to the
that 's kind of
the integration over _eqn_
i can n't see
the metric on the
_SOS_ thats what i
_SOS_ we will not
n't think so _EOS_
such that _eqn_ and
of _eqn_ is given
that 's what it
_eqn_ i e _eqn_
that 's a great
be regarded as a
it 's not even
_SOS_ thus in the
this made me laugh
equations of motion of
if they do n't
_SOS_ you can get
it is obvious that
do n't do it
this means that _eqn_
_SOS_ the form of
i could n't find
it does n't have
it is instructive to
_SOS_ what would you
let _eqn_ be an
do n't see why
the center of mass
i always thought it
in this letter we
's a good thing
_SOS_ over _eqn_ _EOS_
that is all _EOS_
to _eqn_ in the
i think they 're
left hand side of
_SOS_ am i the
in the field theory
i wish i was
of _eqn_ is the
_eqn_ is defined in
at the top of
_eqn_ for any _eqn_
it is n't _EOS_
i can n't stand
is given in _cite_
_SOS_ we begin by
i live in the
_SOS_ look at the
fact that _eqn_ is
that 's the best
the field _eqn_ is
_SOS_ let us define
here ya go __url__
for the most part
using _cite_ and _cite_
_SOS_ not sure why
of the operators _eqn_
_SOS_ we denote the
but i 'm sure
'll just leave this
_SOS_ this suggests that
it was shown in
the fact that you
i 'm and i
same as in the
_SOS_ in the context
the first time _EOS_
a few months ago
the choice of _eqn_
for this purpose we
i 've heard that
_SOS_ we will discuss
for the info _EOS_
i have ever seen
of motion of the
agree with you _EOS_
see for example _cite_
_SOS_ maybe you should
_eqn_ one has _eqn_
do n't know that
the dependence of the
_SOS_ and i 'm
of the low energy
and it 's a
the relation _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ you are the
a factor of _eqn_
_SOS_ where are you
us first consider the
_SOS_ is this a
degrees of freedom in
_SOS_ with _eqn_ _EOS_
you do n't _EOS_
in the light cone
to get rid of
_SOS_ i for one
has the following form
i can n't think
restrict ourselves to the
_SOS_ but what if
that _eqn_ is an
_SOS_ we have a
number of degrees of
_eqn_ and _eqn_ satisfy
it went okay _EOS_
reminds me of the
we find _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ the functions _eqn_
you know it 's
_SOS_ it is natural
_SOS_ nope it 's
i 'll be sure
of the action _EOS_
_SOS_ i think there
_SOS_ the results of
_SOS_ sorry about that
_eqn_ with _eqn_ being
_SOS_ _cite_ is the
sorry about that _EOS_
_eqn_ due to the
what it is _EOS_
_SOS_ this would be
in order to get
_eqn_ then _eqn_ _EOS_
did n't mean to
did n't have to
in section we discuss
_SOS_ the case _eqn_
it can n't be
can see that the
take a look at
_SOS_ pretty sure it
_SOS_ this is due
i 'll give it
the condition _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ i stand corrected
the _eqn_ plane _EOS_
_SOS_ i knew it
_SOS_ the partition function
_eqn_ to be the
from time to time
_SOS_ here ya go
_cite_ it follows that
but you can n't
the tension of the
_SOS_ the low energy
_SOS_ what if you
_SOS_ this was my
_eqn_ gauge theory _EOS_
from what i 've
of the fields _eqn_
_SOS_ i was in
_eqn_ this is the
'm going to go
_eqn_ as in _cite_
thanks for that _EOS_
the eigenvalues of _eqn_
the appearance of the
you 're not a
_SOS_ what 's that
of view of the
_SOS_ or you could
the level of the
_SOS_ of course i
_SOS_ therefore we can
_SOS_ that was n't
where _eqn_ stands for
be rewritten as _eqn_
every time i see
_SOS_ they can be
used to be a
_SOS_ in this context
that it 's a
and _eqn_ are defined
if i remember correctly
_SOS_ yeah me too
_eqn_ given by _cite_
action is given by
have no idea why
it 's a shame
the description of the
_SOS_ there is also
you are correct _EOS_
and it 's not
can be applied to
i am not a
of the coupling constant
_SOS_ this is actually
of this work _EOS_
in the following form
the only thing i
in real life _EOS_
is taken to be
_SOS_ the value of
in the face _EOS_
_SOS_ from now on
yeah that 's what
_SOS_ in the presence
all over the place
if i do n't
the center of the
_SOS_ fair enough i
_SOS_ where _eqn_ denotes
i 'm a girl
the near horizon geometry
_SOS_ i still have
an element of _eqn_
i do n't feel
let us note that
take into account the
that 's what they
_SOS_ i 'm more
due to the presence
_SOS_ i think so
_SOS_ we consider a
_SOS_ the one loop
no i 'm not
_SOS_ there are a
reads _eqn_ where _eqn_
a few weeks ago
the stress energy tensor
of the partition function
think about it _EOS_
_SOS_ if it was
obtain _eqn_ where _eqn_
_SOS_ thanks man _EOS_
of the _eqn_ model
_SOS_ i dunno i
_eqn_ with _eqn_ _eqn_
_SOS_ oh i see
by _eqn_ where the
that 's pretty much
the square of the
a good thing _EOS_
be viewed as a
'll be sure to
the inverse of the
_eqn_ by _eqn_ and
what he said _EOS_
_SOS_ now we are
oh my god i
_SOS_ yep that 's
for large _eqn_ _EOS_
a lot of fun
and so on _EOS_
sorry i do n't
we are grateful to
_SOS_ it took me
the case where _eqn_
like to thank the
well played sir _EOS_
energy momentum tensor _EOS_
i believe it 's
_SOS_ i thought they
_cite_ _eqn_ and _eqn_
_SOS_ we are grateful
it 's on the
n't know if i
the black hole _EOS_
_SOS_ it is shown
_SOS_ that is not
_SOS_ according to _cite_
i need to get
a friend of mine
the case where the
it 's still a
of the open string
_SOS_ i was expecting
purpose of this paper
_SOS_ you can also
this section we shall
do n't know who
in our case the
_SOS_ the spectrum of
on that one _EOS_
_SOS_ why did you
is _eqn_ with _eqn_
_eqn_ defined by _eqn_
do n't know where
a gentleman and a
as a result we
_SOS_ his name is
the following form _cite_
i feel your pain
we will assume that
_SOS_ are you serious
according to eq _EOS_
because it 's a
defined as _eqn_ _EOS_
_eqn_ from eq _EOS_
thanks for the suggestion
_SOS_ thanks :d _EOS_
have shown that the
_SOS_ as is well
_SOS_ i was actually
_SOS_ the relation between
do n't understand the
if i 'm not
was shown in _cite_
it 's the best
then _eqn_ and _eqn_
n't know what you
of the parameter _eqn_
_SOS_ i hate you
in the previous subsection
in that case the
nope nope nope nope
thank you :d _EOS_
that _eqn_ can be
_SOS_ there is an
doing it right _EOS_
do not depend on
i 'm just saying
_SOS_ the solution of
i 'm at work
_SOS_ what does that
the form _eqn_ and
n't even know what
the area of the
gentleman and a scholar
the same as that
the fact that it
this section we consider
_SOS_ most of the
part of the action
i would n't mind
of the matrix _eqn_
_SOS_ i 've done
and _eqn_ are _eqn_
_SOS_ i know you
and _eqn_ is an
_eqn_ given by _eqn_
would have been a
in the study of
you do n't understand
a picture of a
the schr dinger equation
we turn to the
you are talking about
discussed in the previous
do n't think there
is described by a
replaced by _eqn_ _EOS_
that is what i
_eqn_ is an integer
and that 's why
but that 's not
is _eqn_ and _eqn_
_SOS_ you 're doing
that for _eqn_ the
_eqn_ as _eqn_ where
i have yet to
_SOS_ thanks i was
_eqn_ and _eqn_ one
i feel like a
the help of the
do n't like the
follows _eqn_ where _eqn_
_eqn_ in this case
of the day _EOS_
since _eqn_ is a
the best kind of
is shown in fig
know what i 'm
_SOS_ o o _EOS_
leads to the following
_cite_ into eq _EOS_
it 's a little
_eqn_ when _eqn_ _EOS_
no it does n't
_SOS_ well i do
is equivalent to _eqn_
_SOS_ i take it
the coefficient of the
_SOS_ fuck you _EOS_
_SOS_ note that for
's supposed to be
the parameters of the
as shown in _cite_
that i did n't
_SOS_ at least he
the form of _eqn_
seems to be the
term proportional to _eqn_
_SOS_ that is what
can be represented as
of the one loop
when i was in
that 's awesome _EOS_
with _eqn_ where _eqn_
_SOS_ except for the
depends only on the
this is a good
this is consistent with
not sure if i
of the theory is
of _eqn_ with respect
this all the time
_SOS_ you are right
this is because the
a link to the
implies that _eqn_ _EOS_
interesting to note that
you talking about _EOS_
at the very least
of _eqn_ by _eqn_
_SOS_ notice that _eqn_
_SOS_ you 're just
the parameters _eqn_ and
you and me both
_SOS_ first let us
it all the time
'm not sure how
the action for the
along the _eqn_ direction
so i can n't
_SOS_ for me it
we do not know
this means that we
would be a good
_eqn_ as follows _EOS_
i 'm just a
play an important role
this is the most
a few days ago
to the existence of
at a time _EOS_
in the latter case
_SOS_ i really hope
_SOS_ of course this
do you know what
one can check that
_eqn_ dependence of the
no no no no
degrees of freedom are
you 're supposed to
so you do n't
to all orders in
i like you _EOS_
implies that _eqn_ is
_SOS_ i think a
can be generalized to
and _eqn_ in _cite_
i did n't notice
_SOS_ for instance the
_SOS_ if that 's
the same thing i
we can write the
_SOS_ finally let us
i 've heard of
's the only way
follows from eq _EOS_
once in a while
the result is _eqn_
'm pretty sure he
_SOS_ therefore we have
_eqn_ and we have
i 'm sorry but
_SOS_ looks like it
_eqn_ can be expressed
_SOS_ it may be
the fuck are you
i have n't heard
is given by eq
_SOS_ have an upvote
the case when _eqn_
_SOS_ in the latter
thank you thank you
_SOS_ now you 're
at the point _eqn_
_SOS_ by using the
i think i just
_SOS_ there are also
i was just about
at this point _EOS_
to show that _eqn_
did n't have a
that in this case
_cite_ we get _eqn_
n't know why i
in appendix a _EOS_
on the other side
_SOS_ that 's one
the vacuum expectation value
_SOS_ i have an
_SOS_ if _eqn_ the
_SOS_ alpha _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ i saw it
_SOS_ the only thing
_cite_ and _cite_ and
be written as a
sorry to hear that
_SOS_ you know you
the invariance of the
_SOS_ oh i thought
is then given by
_SOS_ you must have
the evaluation of the
me know if you
physical degrees of freedom
_eqn_ in the following
a lot of things
it has to be
we will discuss the
always thought it was
by making use of
i will n't be
the discussion of the
_SOS_ holy shit that
the other hand _eqn_
_cite_ can be rewritten
i laughed so hard
_SOS_ in particular for
you do n't think
_SOS_ did you just
would also like to
_SOS_ we shall now
i 'm sure i
_SOS_ i agree it
next section we will
the other hand in
you are going to
feel like i 'm
we get _eqn_ where
_SOS_ _cite_ we can
_SOS_ i dont think
_eqn_ in the limit
did the same thing
_SOS_ you and me
the symmetry of the
_SOS_ we wish to
it i do n't
the _eqn_ term in
what happens when you
can show that the
not sure what you
_SOS_ i will n't
with _eqn_ being the
thanks for the offer
the lie algebra _eqn_
_SOS_ sorry i 'm
for _eqn_ can be
have no idea _EOS_
in the next subsection
in _cite_ that the
what you think it
_SOS_ that 's right
_SOS_ the next step
_SOS_ i hope so
of the space time
_SOS_ i know a
of quantum field theory
's one of my
_SOS_ _cite_ which is
if you 're in
this is equivalent to
_SOS_ i dont know
obtained in _cite_ _EOS_
_eqn_ are defined by
i read this in
the heads up _EOS_
we restrict ourselves to
_SOS_ there 's always
can be seen as
can n't seem to
in the form _EOS_
i will have to
leading order in _eqn_
can be understood as
think that 's the
_SOS_ to find the
yes yes it is
_SOS_ let us assume
what 's the point
_SOS_ it 's always
with the fact that
the green s function
thought it was funny
do you have to
that _eqn_ is not
i read your comment
the result of the
_SOS_ in particular this
_SOS_ yes i 'm
_SOS_ you should be
is easy to show
_SOS_ care to elaborate
to see that _eqn_
to check it out
to check that the
_SOS_ never heard of
_SOS_ the first one
thanks for the advice
the field strength _eqn_
_SOS_ why is it
form _eqn_ with _eqn_
_SOS_ i know _EOS_
partition function of the
_eqn_ is a real
i like the way
_eqn_ and _eqn_ at
seems to be a
was referring to the
we are dealing with
in this case one
the more you know
_SOS_ you guys are
in the construction of
_SOS_ where 's the
this is indeed the
_eqn_ corresponds to a
is what i was
_SOS_ why is that
_cite_ with respect to
it 's like the
of _eqn_ for _eqn_
that made me laugh
the stability of the
the standard model _EOS_
you 're not the
are n't you _EOS_
we set _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ how is this
as discussed in _cite_
_SOS_ i wonder how
_eqn_ correspond to the
can n't help but
of the effective potential
i was n't aware
on the space of
_SOS_ i think she
of the field theory
in the right hand
this is how i
he does n't have
in the previous sections
_SOS_ now consider the
would have to be
_SOS_ i prefer the
described in terms of
gauge group is _eqn_
i 've ever heard
do n't see it
of _eqn_ where _eqn_
equation of motion _EOS_
it 's actually a
do you think i
of _eqn_ as _eqn_
_SOS_ this should be
the group _eqn_ _EOS_
does n't make sense
that _eqn_ for _eqn_
did n't know about
of the lie algebra
_eqn_ for some _eqn_
out of me _EOS_
if i had a
in order to find
_SOS_ we have to
there 's a difference
if you 're interested
take the limit _eqn_
_SOS_ why is this
_eqn_ and for _eqn_
_SOS_ we take the
at first i thought
no it is n't
of the brane _EOS_
_SOS_ thank you it
as _eqn_ where the
that 's why _EOS_
the difference between the
_SOS_ as opposed to
coupling constant _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ not that i
_eqn_ of _eqn_ is
how did you get
the aim of this
_eqn_ symmetry of the
sorry i did n't
_eqn_ does not depend
that was the first
i was able to
is interesting to note
_eqn_ _eqn_ for _eqn_
to see it _EOS_
_eqn_ in _cite_ and
figure out how to
that 's where i
the gauge theory _EOS_
is the first time
the quantization of the
did n't think of
taking the limit _eqn_
_SOS_ the analysis of
looks like it 's
_SOS_ that 's probably
_eqn_ it follows that
_SOS_ yes __url__ _EOS_
the coefficients of the
in the effective action
of the world _EOS_
_SOS_ the reason for
have you seen the
_SOS_ i should have
_eqn_ of eq _EOS_
_eqn_ and _eqn_ so
do n't understand what
_SOS_ thus _eqn_ is
it looks like it
there is also a
ya go __url__ _EOS_
_SOS_ directed by m
we can obtain the
i stand corrected _EOS_
with _eqn_ _eqn_ and
_SOS_ yes yes i
in order to make
_SOS_ i 'm assuming
so that _eqn_ is
_SOS_ i saw that
on the basis of
at finite temperature _EOS_
the only thing that
tell me about it
the bosonic part of
's the joke _EOS_
depicted in fig _EOS_
_SOS_ it could be
easy to show that
_SOS_ i wanted to
the _eqn_ model _EOS_
_SOS_ glad i could
_SOS_ note however that
_SOS_ there 's an
consider the case _eqn_
_SOS_ let us introduce
at some point _EOS_
the imaginary part of
the one with the
it 's called a
the symmetries of the
it was a good
with gauge group _eqn_
_SOS_ now i 'm
equal to zero _EOS_
_eqn_ and hence _eqn_
not sure why you
if you have to
in the einstein frame
loss of generality we
that 's for sure
_SOS_ fuck yeah _EOS_
to _eqn_ and the
_SOS_ there you go
the proof of the
but i could n't
in terms of these
it 's a joke
where the _eqn_ are
that sounds like a
the zero modes of
how do they work
this allows us to
have the form _eqn_
where it 's at
_SOS_ i fucking love
in the _eqn_ theory
i think he means
the form of a
_SOS_ thank you that
the masses of the
and _eqn_ and the
i was thinking about
_SOS_ it is given
do with it _EOS_
and i 'm a
the paper is as
i get it _EOS_
the validity of the
_SOS_ it is useful
_SOS_ well there 's
is invariant under _eqn_
this is going to
_SOS_ i knew i
of the ads cft
stuck in my head
that the number of
_SOS_ yeah this is
for the existence of
that 's why they
the cosmological constant problem
_SOS_ the construction of
_SOS_ yeah i did
in this case there
meme detected upvoting _EOS_
_SOS_ it went okay
_SOS_ this is also
_SOS_ you 've never
a representation of the
here it is __url__
in the vicinity of
_SOS_ we expect that
all the way _EOS_
did n't get it
the _eqn_ and the
i would have to
the boundary of _eqn_
_SOS_ some of us
be of the form
i have the same
the general form of
_SOS_ to do this
do n't believe in
_SOS_ if you think
of _eqn_ with the
_SOS_ in contrast to
if you 're going
_eqn_ for the _eqn_
i hate it when
_SOS_ yeah it is
_eqn_ such that the
did n't see that
section we consider the
do n't you think
of the _eqn_ dimensional
_eqn_ where _eqn_ the
i have to agree
_SOS_ me gusta _EOS_
this point of view
for _eqn_ in the
i was just thinking
but i would n't
zero modes of the
_SOS_ i really do
_SOS_ we start by
_SOS_ it really is
of the d brane
is supported by the
looks like he 's
presented in _cite_ _EOS_
that would have been
i think i have
this case we have
and _eqn_ _cite_ _EOS_
leave this here __url__
_SOS_ you have n't
_eqn_ and it is
it 's just not
representations of _eqn_ _EOS_
_eqn_ to be a
i 'm on the
but i have n't
of the _eqn_ gauge
at this point we
to go to the
field theory _cite_ _EOS_
i 'm kind of
_SOS_ you just made
the lie algebra of
are determined by the
you can n't be
in _cite_ in the
wish i could upvote
_SOS_ me too but
proportional to _eqn_ and
_SOS_ he is a
we have introduced the
but i 'm pretty
in the four dimensional
at large _eqn_ _EOS_
it seems to be
_SOS_ next we consider
did not know that
it 's nice to
where _eqn_ _eqn_ _EOS_
are in order _EOS_
the whole thing _EOS_
moduli space of the
why thank you _EOS_
_SOS_ i did the
_SOS_ lambda _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ you might want
the length of the
_SOS_ of course _EOS_
are invariant under the
of the _eqn_ algebra
would n't want to
but i 've never
the metric of the
_SOS_ it is _EOS_
_SOS_ the boundary conditions
_SOS_ you 're an
in the r h
_SOS_ you 're very
of the universe _EOS_
_SOS_ they are n't
in perturbation theory _EOS_
_SOS_ why did i
of the gauge fields
as long as they
can be rewritten in
boundary conditions for the
but you do n't
_SOS_ that 'd be
given in ref _EOS_
_SOS_ the field _eqn_
the point of the
_SOS_ this is consistent
i used to be
_SOS_ did n't know
_eqn_ and _eqn_ denote
_cite_ and _cite_ in
so it 's not
give it a shot
is assumed to be
_SOS_ good for you
we begin with the
_eqn_ and _eqn_ will
there 's a lot
the fact that i
the point _eqn_ _EOS_
to take into account
we have a winner
do n't even _EOS_
instead of _eqn_ _EOS_
i have never seen
the solution to the
i was thinking more
shown in _cite_ that
a big fan of
supersymmetric yang mills theory
are of the form
it 's not as
i 'm guessing you
vectors _eqn_ and _eqn_
by the fact that
would like to know
_cite_ and _cite_ _eqn_
haters gonna hate _EOS_
i was under the
the _eqn_ limit _EOS_
i 'm an idiot
the absence of the
it 's awesome _EOS_
on the world volume
_SOS_ it 's hard
the world volume of
not a fan of
we will see in
_SOS_ you should n't
the order of _eqn_
_SOS_ that 's good
is identified with the
_SOS_ do n't tell
that there exists a
_SOS_ i 've only
_eqn_ is of the
_SOS_ did you see
_SOS_ we hope to
_SOS_ i heard that
_SOS_ this is precisely
_eqn_ _eqn_ with _eqn_
you kind sir _EOS_
_SOS_ what was the
closely related to the
_SOS_ the results are
i 've been to
_eqn_ to _eqn_ and
thanks for reminding me
_SOS_ it 's cool
is indeed the case
of the _eqn_ matrix
the guy in the
do the same thing
for all values of
_SOS_ yes i do
the consistency of the
_SOS_ _cite_ where we
i 'll do it
_SOS_ the rest of
heard of it _EOS_
_eqn_ for _eqn_ _eqn_
it 's pretty much
i have to go
subgroup of _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ haters gonna hate
first order in _eqn_
because you do n't
one finds that the
_SOS_ consider now the
i 'm sure the
as long as _eqn_
we 're going to
no idea what you
the d _eqn_ brane
string theory on _eqn_
you can get a
_SOS_ here we shall
in the uk _EOS_
_SOS_ i 'm curious
is obtained from the
as long as the
we expect that the
found in ref _EOS_
it 's a very
_SOS_ thank you kind
for example in the
_SOS_ i have not
where _eqn_ with _eqn_
and there is no
was going to post
_SOS_ __url__ __url__ _EOS_
the integral over _eqn_
_SOS_ the situation is
no it 's a
it 's just that
the quantity _eqn_ is
_SOS_ in the absence
this needs to be
_SOS_ there are no
it used to be
if that 's what
the _eqn_ gauge theory
_SOS_ let 's not
_SOS_ there are many
_cite_ and _cite_ respectively
you 'd be surprised
_SOS_ let us discuss
this is a great
_SOS_ this one is
equation _eqn_ where _eqn_
_SOS_ so we have
that 's it _EOS_
_SOS_ yes that is
we conclude that _eqn_
do they work _EOS_
the energy density of
_SOS_ i got it
_eqn_ has the form
that 's not how
type iia string theory
_eqn_ leads to the
i guess i should
i can n't say
it is difficult to
_SOS_ oh i know
_eqn_ defined in _cite_
_SOS_ would you like
_cite_ and _cite_ for
action is invariant under
pics or it did
do you know how
the generators of _eqn_
_SOS_ the effective action
that 's how you
_SOS_ haha yeah i
to note that the
on the boundary of
rest of the world
_SOS_ the gauge group
it 's better than
do n't mind me
in the language of
no you 're thinking
the cosmological constant _EOS_
'll be able to
becomes _eqn_ where _eqn_
does n't want to
to the equations of
something like this __url__
the present paper is
_cite_ as well as
do n't care about
is _eqn_ where the
might be able to
thank you i 'm
this is precisely the
that you can n't
the rest of this
the _eqn_ component of
here to say the
one has _eqn_ _EOS_
defined by _eqn_ where
it was one of
we do n't need
where we have defined
_eqn_ see _cite_ _EOS_
n't worry about it
_SOS_ of course not
and _eqn_ as _eqn_
_SOS_ this was the
point of view the
_SOS_ now we consider
you have n't seen
i think he meant
of the wilson loop
_SOS_ he 's just
_ix_ _ix_ and _ix_
give it a try
the coefficient of _eqn_
i do n't use
see that _eqn_ is
_eqn_ is the metric
for pointing that out
_SOS_ no it does
it is not possible
_eqn_ yang mills theory
you ask me _EOS_
_SOS_ concluding remarks _EOS_
you 've got a
_SOS_ for _eqn_ this
_SOS_ tell me about
_cite_ in order to
this is why we
_SOS_ section is devoted
do n't think anyone
_SOS_ yeah but the
_eqn_ in the form
not sure if you
the _eqn_ part of
_cite_ and _cite_ one
i 'm so sorry
_SOS_ yeah i just
as well as _eqn_
_SOS_ well played sir
given by _cite_ _eqn_
_SOS_ nailed it _EOS_
_SOS_ we believe that
corresponding to _eqn_ _EOS_
in that case i
is a solution of
that 's a lot
it does n't make
the strong coupling limit
_SOS_ haha i 'm
of the _eqn_ function
is denoted by _eqn_
to be fair i
be taken into account
he was talking about
_SOS_ the appearance of
see if i can
from the viewpoint of
that 's the first
i 've always wanted
is generated by the
_SOS_ as explained in
have to be a
in the near horizon
to post this _EOS_
make use of the
the other side of
i think you meant
is expected to be
_SOS_ for example for
but i think i
_SOS_ did you know
is _eqn_ which is
in appendix b _EOS_
just leave this here
_SOS_ i was a
note that _eqn_ and
_SOS_ you do realize
in the _eqn_ dimensional
_SOS_ no i have
the components of _eqn_
_SOS_ this allows us
you must be a
is known to be
to think of it
let us now turn
you must be new
in the background _EOS_
in the gauge theory
_SOS_ the choice of
i had the same
did n't see it
the relation between _eqn_
_SOS_ actually i think
_SOS_ in particular in
_SOS_ if i could
shown in ref _EOS_
_SOS_ they did n't
in _cite_ we have
be one of the
in the path integral
defined in terms of
_SOS_ that made me
it is enough to
case _eqn_ and _eqn_
they 're going to
i was waiting for
the _eqn_ field _EOS_
at the bottom of
is found to be
is not possible to
will n't be able
_SOS_ the problem is
_eqn_ and _eqn_ then
_SOS_ the first is
i was going for
_SOS_ i know the
also like to thank
_SOS_ i 'm at
of _eqn_ at _eqn_
from _eqn_ and _eqn_
to leading order in
you want me to
a lot more than
the integration over the
_SOS_ one can easily
as a kid _EOS_
has been shown that
in the game _EOS_
in other words _eqn_
that 's how it
i like how you
terms proportional to _eqn_
it does n't _EOS_
string theory _cite_ _EOS_
_SOS_ i did this
the renormalization of the
how old are you
the u s _EOS_
i have a friend
the central charge _eqn_
_eqn_ of _eqn_ and
it 's a lot
_SOS_ i had the
similar to the one
_SOS_ it 's one
_eqn_ on _eqn_ is
of radius _eqn_ _EOS_
you like it _EOS_
a good one _EOS_
of the chern simons
_SOS_ you know it
and _eqn_ are arbitrary
_SOS_ department of energy
_SOS_ what makes you
for me it 's
the number of the
_SOS_ yeah i guess
let us discuss the
'll give it a
_SOS_ the proof of
_SOS_ yeah i have
for any value of
_SOS_ i am in
derivatives with respect to
_SOS_ not sure what
in this limit _EOS_
i 'd rather have
in front of the
_SOS_ no but it
the minimum of the
it was going to
the speed of light
boundary conditions on the
sense of humor _EOS_
_eqn_ as _eqn_ and
can n't wait _EOS_
i 'm a little
what follows we will
in fact it is
that 's not true
_eqn_ can be found
does n't mean it
_eqn_ and _eqn_ do
this is my favorite
_SOS_ upvote for you
is provided by the
_SOS_ you sound like
and _eqn_ of the
the limit of _eqn_
would n't be surprised
of freedom of the
to be sure _EOS_
do n't you have
low energy effective theory
_SOS_ scriptscriptstyle _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ what is it
_eqn_ we have _EOS_
n't tell if you
_eqn_ _eqn_ are the
not to mention the
_SOS_ it 's what
in the strong coupling
i was wondering if
the same is true
how do you get
take _eqn_ to be
the first two terms
to be honest _EOS_
_SOS_ thank you good
_SOS_ we remark that
in this paper is
what are you doing
order to obtain the
_SOS_ i found it
and _eqn_ is given
i 'm a guy
now let us consider
is n't going to
that is _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ hey i 'm
_SOS_ without loss of
_SOS_ happy birthday _EOS_
_SOS_ if we take
_SOS_ make sure you
we have defined _eqn_
_SOS_ let us note
for that matter _EOS_
_SOS_ this is done
n't give a fuck
_SOS_ from the above
just do n't know
_SOS_ this does not
long as it 's
and let _eqn_ be
my first thought was
_SOS_ the _eqn_ and
the last time i
the coupling of the
you can n't have
_SOS_ let us begin
no you do n't
_SOS_ we recall that
may or may not
_SOS_ however there are
_SOS_ i did it
discussed in section _cite_
was under the impression
_SOS_ there 's also
of the _eqn_ symmetry
in the _eqn_ and
that makes sense _EOS_
note that the _eqn_
this is n't a
_SOS_ i see your
the gauge field _EOS_
_SOS_ mind blown _EOS_
group is _eqn_ _EOS_
general form of the
me of this __url__
_SOS_ gamma _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ i have one
_SOS_ for the sake
think that 's a
i might have to
the equation _eqn_ _EOS_
the one loop effective
this here __url__ _EOS_
i 've been looking
of _eqn_ or _eqn_
the general solution of
this i do n't
_eqn_ is the volume
and _eqn_ we have
are a gentleman and
have you ever seen
of _eqn_ we have
string field theory _EOS_
the back of the
_eqn_ we get the
i read it in
as far as the
now i do n't
_SOS_ yes it was
the equation for _eqn_
is very similar to
p t i o
_eqn_ is _eqn_ and
the first thing that
and i 've never
the effective action for
_eqn_ is obtained by
i 'll take a
_SOS_ then it is
did n't even think
not sure if serious
of _eqn_ is a
the region _eqn_ _EOS_
where did you get
i 'm not alone
in the continuum limit
_SOS_ if you were
given by the following
_SOS_ we can then
did n't know it
_SOS_ let me know
the other hand if
_SOS_ yes it does
case of the _eqn_
_SOS_ we have found
what is this _EOS_
_eqn_ there is no
wish i had a
i 'm just going
thus we see that
_SOS_ that 's funny
the near horizon limit
_SOS_ in fact _eqn_
i feel bad for
_SOS_ it did n't
_SOS_ the operators _eqn_
_SOS_ as it is
if it was a
to do this we
_SOS_ but if you
is identical to the
the case in which
what makes you think
when i saw this
with _eqn_ _eqn_ _EOS_
do n't live in
open string field theory
_eqn_ and _eqn_ from
i 'll look into
_SOS_ at this stage
but that 's just
the next step is
to begin with _EOS_
_SOS_ since _eqn_ and
i read this as
such that _eqn_ is
wrong with that _EOS_
and _cite_ we obtain
was about to say
_SOS_ and now i
_eqn_ gauge theory with
_SOS_ we study the
and now i 'm
be able to get
of the potential _EOS_
_SOS_ well to be
the low energy theory
_SOS_ well done _EOS_
if you want _EOS_
it is clear from
_SOS_ since we have
some of the best
end aligned _eqn_ _EOS_
feel the same way
can n't say i
vacuum expectation value of
's more of a
are defined by _eqn_
_SOS_ for example if
that i 'm not
_SOS_ looks like you
this is not a
_SOS_ pics or it
_SOS_ is there any
the product of the
_SOS_ the problem of
get out of my
as in the _eqn_
you so much for
the _eqn_ gauge group
to get out of
_SOS_ _cite_ for a
he did n't say
does n't mean you
we shall use the
_SOS_ do you want
pointed out in _cite_
_SOS_ thus we see
does n't work _EOS_
_eqn_ replaced by _eqn_
at least that 's
i think that is
we will refer to
_eqn_ in agreement with
do n't really know
_SOS_ i got the
_eqn_ in _eqn_ and
and _eqn_ denotes the
get off my lawn
in this section _EOS_
there is no way
large _eqn_ limit of
thought it would be
_SOS_ that 's so
the hilbert space of
_SOS_ yeah but that
in more detail _EOS_
_SOS_ i do _EOS_
the _eqn_ symmetry of
by _cite_ and _cite_
thanks for the correction
do n't listen to
in such a case
in which _eqn_ is
the way to go
_SOS_ it is instructive
n't seem to be
is different from the
to each his own
_SOS_ in any case
and thank you _EOS_
_SOS_ that 's where
in what follows _EOS_
all values of _eqn_
of the game _EOS_
_eqn_ and similarly for
e p t i
_SOS_ as much as
_eqn_ is replaced by
_SOS_ i think your
elements of _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ get out of
_SOS_ this has been
a little bit _EOS_
the change of variables
_SOS_ so brave _EOS_
in the action _EOS_
_SOS_ do n't think
is the sum of
_SOS_ my guess is
different values of _eqn_
i can n't be
the _eqn_ s _EOS_
_SOS_ do n't get
we find _eqn_ where
the coefficients _eqn_ and
you think it means
_SOS_ shut up and
solution is given by
i 'm on a
in the following section
because it 's not
_SOS_ the factor _eqn_
in a long time
_SOS_ i thought so
in this sense the
_eqn_ are related to
was just trying to
_SOS_ how about a
of the _eqn_ term
_SOS_ my name is
discussed in ref _EOS_
of the two dimensional
there 's a reason
and you do n't
be denoted by _eqn_
_SOS_ he has a
we will focus on
_SOS_ my bad i
_SOS_ next let us
_cite_ and eq _EOS_
it does n't look
_SOS_ in this respect
believe it or not
is n't that the
of the closed string
in this case it
way to go _EOS_
can be seen by
in high school _EOS_
equations of motion and
think i 've ever
_SOS_ check out the
to the number of
a solution to the
m night shyamalan _EOS_
_SOS_ i liked the
_eqn_ _eqn_ or _eqn_
next step is to
under the impression that
_SOS_ if _eqn_ and
before it was cool
i could be wrong
the rank of the
_SOS_ one can see
go for it _EOS_
_SOS_ however as we
a good way to
it is also possible
n't think it was
it as well _EOS_
note that _eqn_ _EOS_
on the brane is
you will n't be
_SOS_ why can n't
the anti de sitter
_SOS_ on the contrary
one hell of a
_SOS_ if you like
that this is not
_SOS_ fuck you i
element of _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ what is that
_eqn_ note that the
_SOS_ this needs to
the fundamental representation of
if you 'd like
the topology of the
in my life _EOS_
the moduli space is
be found in the
n't know why but
the presence of _eqn_
what 's your point
the way down _EOS_
where _eqn_ is some
i have n't had
work is supported in
_SOS_ or at least
only if _eqn_ _EOS_
that 's just like
will show that the
_SOS_ no thank you
one of the _eqn_
defined by _eqn_ and
your opinion man _EOS_
_SOS_ you 're _EOS_
and _eqn_ are not
m theory on _eqn_
you were talking about
_SOS_ i 'm only
in the open string
discussed in section _EOS_
i 'm looking at
_SOS_ and do n't
_SOS_ it means that
it did n't work
the btz black hole
_SOS_ as soon as
gauge invariance of the
_SOS_ well it was
_eqn_ it is easy
_SOS_ and you 're
very similar to the
_SOS_ how are you
field theory on the
get _eqn_ where _eqn_
i feel the same
_SOS_ done and done
generated by _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ sigma _eqn_ _EOS_
do n't understand _EOS_
_eqn_ and therefore _eqn_
c e p t
fap fap fap fap
the shape of the
energy momentum tensor _eqn_
you did n't know
_SOS_ let _eqn_ _eqn_
_SOS_ you will n't
thanks for the help
write _eqn_ where _eqn_
equation _cite_ can be
it 's time to
_SOS_ one can show
works for me _EOS_
functions of _eqn_ _EOS_
that they do n't
_eqn_ is called the
amp nbsp amp nbsp
_SOS_ you made me
a special case of
may be written as
they do n't want
i read it as
of the path integral
_SOS_ haha i was
we shall consider the
_SOS_ the best part
this paper we consider
did n't know you
to the study of
first of all we
to be in the
_SOS_ nope __url__ _EOS_
partially supported by the
_SOS_ would n't that
by virtue of the
_SOS_ so you are
we have found that
_SOS_ the plan of
i 'm not _EOS_
_SOS_ for example we
i 'm gonna go
_SOS_ i upvoted you
in two dimensions _EOS_
_SOS_ however we can
_SOS_ you beat me
_eqn_ see eq _EOS_
i 'll take it
is convenient to introduce
yeah it 's a
_SOS_ that is n't
with _eqn_ in the
_eqn_ in the case
thought it was just
_SOS_ because he 's
the parameter _eqn_ _EOS_
i did the same
is analogous to the
care to elaborate _EOS_
we note that _eqn_
_SOS_ with _eqn_ and
_SOS_ let us take
is the best _EOS_
and _eqn_ do not
it 's worth it
it will n't be
that this is the
enhancement suite __url__ _EOS_
to the case _eqn_
and similarly for _eqn_
not even once _EOS_
i knew it was
it can be seen
_SOS_ y u no
_cite_ for _eqn_ and
_SOS_ i believe he
_eqn_ can be identified
_SOS_ we shall see
how did you know
at first i was
in the quantum theory
the induced metric on
the same way _EOS_
_SOS_ who the fuck
yang mills theory in
_SOS_ you can do
_eqn_ s and _eqn_
_SOS_ if i 'm
bosonic part of the
'd say it 's
given by _cite_ and
_SOS_ we observe that
_SOS_ you got it
let us turn to
you just made me
_SOS_ the quantity _eqn_
we can n't have
_SOS_ nope i 'm
this paper we shall
are independent of the
why i do n't
_SOS_ i 'll get
of _eqn_ to the
like your opinion man
the representation of the
_SOS_ thanks for your
respect to the _eqn_
i 'm on my
we refer the reader
_SOS_ yeah you 're
is not invariant under
the present paper _EOS_
think you 're right
and _eqn_ have the
no i did n't
a fan of the
are you sure you
this paper is as
_SOS_ the calculation of
i 've seen that
does n't it _EOS_
is the so called
thank you i was
the contribution to the
by the presence of
please tell me you
_SOS_ nah it 's
play the role of
of _eqn_ as a
you did n't get
_SOS_ for large _eqn_
i do n't mean
_SOS_ the organization of
every now and then
energy density of the
out of my head
and _eqn_ are related
this is n't the
_SOS_ the most general
it that way _EOS_
_SOS_ following _cite_ we
at the top _EOS_
_SOS_ well that was
_eqn_ is a positive
takes the form _EOS_
to be fair it
_SOS_ all of them
of the yang mills
of the ground state
thought it was the
_SOS_ we choose the
you 're probably right
because they do n't
refer the reader to
is given in terms
this is the internet
i 'm not that
the asymptotic behavior of
_SOS_ i was referring
so that _eqn_ and
_SOS_ i am going
this leads to a
_SOS_ the result of
but you have to
_SOS_ in section the
for the love of
section we review the
you can do it
's a good idea
_SOS_ some of the
_SOS_ department of physics
the top of my
equation of motion of
what does that mean
_SOS_ this may be
i did n't _EOS_
'm not sure why
can be reduced to
_SOS_ it 'd be
the distance between the
it 's good to
us start with the
_SOS_ good point i
a large number of
in the rest of
thanks for sharing _EOS_
_eqn_ with _eqn_ a
it makes you feel
of _eqn_ to _eqn_
and vice versa _EOS_
to you sir _EOS_
_SOS_ _cite_ _eqn_ _EOS_
what is it _EOS_
_SOS_ yes please _EOS_
the effective action of
i 'll allow it
is closely related to
by m night shyamalan
this work has been
and is given by
i think i might
_SOS_ consider first the
i think they are
is wrong with you
this shows that the
_cite_ into _cite_ we
to this __url__ _EOS_
's what i meant
us now turn to
_SOS_ the action for
_SOS_ yes i have
_SOS_ this makes me
the special case of
part of _eqn_ _EOS_
what do you want
for _eqn_ is _eqn_
when i was younger
i 've ever read
is defined as the
_SOS_ actually i 'm
form _eqn_ where the
_SOS_ let us briefly
if that 's the
i think you accidentally
the equation of state
i think you might
of _eqn_ in eq
_SOS_ the general solution
as long as i
'm pretty sure you
of the world sheet
_SOS_ _cite_ here _eqn_
_SOS_ i came to
_SOS_ as do i
_SOS_ begin aligned _EOS_
_SOS_ you know that
_cite_ we find _eqn_
_SOS_ in _cite_ a
like the way you
i 'm willing to
solution to eq _EOS_
_SOS_ in fact in
i 've been trying
have an upvote for
we find the following
good to know i
it follows from the
i take it you
will be denoted by
of a black hole
the one on the
_SOS_ yes thank you
variation of the action
's the point of
the term _eqn_ in
_eqn_ of the form
i can tell you
_cite_ takes the form
is that it 's
's for sure _EOS_
the hamiltonian of the
_SOS_ the matrix _eqn_
_SOS_ who does n't
here _eqn_ denotes the
you 're an idiot
_SOS_ i 'll do
the elements of _eqn_
_SOS_ yeah i 'd
can be read off
i need to know
note that we have
_SOS_ i just did
in the closed string
_eqn_ is an _eqn_
if you have any
independent of _eqn_ and
that is exactly what
is where it 's
the _eqn_ are the
_SOS_ wait what _EOS_
we do not need
a lot of money
scalar field _eqn_ _EOS_
for a second _EOS_
of the fields _EOS_
and _cite_ respectively _EOS_
i 've heard it
described in _cite_ _EOS_
reminds me of this
_SOS_ we will denote
but i have a
and _eqn_ are constants
to do this _EOS_
_SOS_ yeah i thought
_eqn_ are given in
_SOS_ i hate that
an element of the
it follows from _cite_
shut up and take
first term in the
you 're very welcome
_SOS_ who are you
shown in _cite_ _EOS_
for the construction of
you want to be
_SOS_ speak for yourself
to the _eqn_ case
_SOS_ there are three
to figure out how
i second this _EOS_
we have that _eqn_
is known as the
means what you think
in this note we
think it means _EOS_
and _eqn_ on the
it looks like the
of the non abelian
oh my god _EOS_
_SOS_ no i was
proposed in _cite_ _EOS_
_eqn_ and let _eqn_
would n't it be
_SOS_ _cite_ that the
_SOS_ that 's really
_eqn_ then _eqn_ and
do n't worry it
do you live in
let us introduce the
_SOS_ am grateful to
in the ass _EOS_
of the _eqn_ _eqn_
when i saw it
it was the first
the generalization of the
however this is not
see what i can
for _eqn_ or _eqn_
when you need him
_SOS_ yes i was
_eqn_ corresponds to _eqn_
_SOS_ this thread is
was partially supported by
the normalization of the
the other hand _EOS_
_SOS_ in particular one
for helpful discussions _EOS_
n't know if it
_SOS_ we denote by
i still can n't
given by eqs _EOS_
i think you have
_SOS_ i will be
_SOS_ the fields _eqn_
_SOS_ is supported by
the fuck up _EOS_
i could help _EOS_
the quantum level _EOS_
'm pretty sure they
_eqn_ is generated by
_SOS_ no i am
does not have a
_eqn_ and _eqn_ that
i 've been doing
_SOS_ the point is
it 's ok i
_SOS_ in this note
i like your style
i was in the
we must have _eqn_
i am not sure
our attention to the
_SOS_ we obtain the
me laugh out loud
do n't think this
the vector field _eqn_
_cite_ where _eqn_ are
of course it 's
we observe that the
when i do i
_SOS_ in a similar
_SOS_ no worries i
_eqn_ is in the
to do so _EOS_
i 've been using
linear combination of the
_SOS_ for _eqn_ there
i 'd say that
_SOS_ he looks like
with _eqn_ and the
_SOS_ at _eqn_ the
it 's easy to
_SOS_ it 's almost
the other hand it
_SOS_ in addition there
you 're the one
are as follows _EOS_
know i 'm not
_SOS_ like i said
a symmetry of the
i 'm starting to
that _eqn_ does not
_ix_ and _ix_ we
i hate you _EOS_
_SOS_ we will be
i 'm not mistaken
_eqn_ gauge group _EOS_
good for you _EOS_
and _eqn_ to be
what is wrong with
'm pretty sure the
one loop effective action
_SOS_ reddit enhancement suite
where we have introduced
are going to be
is replaced by _eqn_
for example _cite_ _EOS_
i do n't give
_SOS_ _cite_ _eqn_ where
it is it 's
_SOS_ the study of
_SOS_ yeah i can
_SOS_ i thought about
does not contribute to
he 's got a
us consider the case
by the u s
that 's just a
_SOS_ i agree that
the problem of the
's why i 'm
we have used _eqn_
_SOS_ the _eqn_ are
n't know what to
_SOS_ or if you
can be done by
_SOS_ here _eqn_ are
do n't go to
_SOS_ the term _eqn_
i think about it
_SOS_ the constant _eqn_
_SOS_ then who was
_SOS_ what if i
can be shown to
i have n't played
in accordance with the
i 'm about to
we shall see that
_SOS_ finally in section
_SOS_ so did i
if it does n't
with _eqn_ given by
have a problem with
is important to note
_SOS_ this guy is
in one to one
_eqn_ where _eqn_ with
you 've got to
by means of a
so i did n't
consider the case where
did n't see the
_eqn_ _eqn_ is a
has a lot of
's the point _EOS_
as _eqn_ and the
_SOS_ did you read
the limit _eqn_ we
_SOS_ what is your
_eqn_ depends on _eqn_
_SOS_ using _cite_ and
have n't heard of
_SOS_ that 's all
the meaning of the
_eqn_ where _eqn_ for
i agree with this
i do not think
the other hand for
_SOS_ thus there is
i was looking at
though i do n't
do n't tell me
the presence of an
all the time and
of the lorentz group
_SOS_ i bet he
of the metric _EOS_
i think there 's
the fourier transform of
_SOS_ do you really
_SOS_ this follows from
_eqn_ note that _eqn_
the fact that he
_cite_ and _cite_ is
will be able to
_SOS_ thanks it 's
the boundary conditions _EOS_
_SOS_ the explicit form
is a lot of
now that i think
similar to that of
_SOS_ here is a
the equation for the
we shall show that
what i can do
non abelian gauge theories
think of it as
_SOS_ one way to
_SOS_ thank you and
i 've ever had
the following expression for
_SOS_ cool thanks _EOS_
_eqn_ is a solution
factor of _eqn_ _EOS_
it 's okay i
_SOS_ and then you
the quantum field theory
important to note that
you just do n't
the limit of large
think that 's what
by _eqn_ in the
in the u s
action _eqn_ where _eqn_
if there is a
_SOS_ looks like the
the effects of the
differentiation with respect to
it is known _EOS_
_eqn_ for large _eqn_
that all the time
do n't you _EOS_
the sum over _eqn_
_SOS_ in my experience
the klein gordon equation
get back to you
the spectrum of _eqn_
_SOS_ can you explain
the entropy of the
_cite_ where we have
never heard of this
_eqn_ coincides with the
in the title _EOS_
_eqn_ is isomorphic to
why did n't you
_SOS_ i wonder what
of the choice of
_SOS_ it makes me
_SOS_ therefore in the
_SOS_ i 'm also
as we have already
_SOS_ that looks like
large values of _eqn_
_SOS_ you mean you
be regarded as the
_SOS_ we refer to
did n't know what
_SOS_ that 's cool
_SOS_ this gives the
a way that the
_SOS_ from _cite_ and
_SOS_ you are welcome
i may have to
if _eqn_ then the
_SOS_ no i just
for this reason we
_SOS_ first we consider
_SOS_ i did that
_SOS_ it 's good
in the _eqn_ model
_SOS_ from the point
_SOS_ i was looking
_SOS_ let 's just
the positions of the
if you are n't
the set of all
for _eqn_ and the
you can n't do
_SOS_ then _eqn_ and
do you think it
_SOS_ it is obvious
_SOS_ yes they are
_eqn_ and can be
still do n't get
_SOS_ in soviet russia
is the fact that
at the origin of
you think it 's
's why it 's
the interpretation of the
_SOS_ that is awesome
representation of the _eqn_
be expressed as _eqn_
just like your opinion
_SOS_ i hate to
_SOS_ the solution is
_SOS_ we have not
it 's from the
_SOS_ can n't wait
to write down the
be applied to the
do n't have an
_eqn_ and _eqn_ it
of a bitch _EOS_
gauge field _eqn_ _EOS_
not at all _EOS_
the effective action _eqn_
to figure out what
of this section _EOS_
one of these __url__
_SOS_ is n't the
_SOS_ the first step
to the front page
which is equivalent to
has the form _EOS_
i forgot about that
department of energy under
it took me a
_SOS_ this is probably
_eqn_ limit of the
of the heterotic string
_SOS_ an example of
was n't sure if
does not change the
you are right _EOS_
_SOS_ this one __url__
_eqn_ with _eqn_ where
defined by eq _EOS_
i have never heard
_SOS_ if i were
equation for _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ here _eqn_ denotes
i 'm afraid i
a result of the
_SOS_ we know that
pain in the ass
it is impossible to
pretty much the same
from now on _EOS_
the _eqn_ symmetry _EOS_
i 'm in a
is associated with the
_SOS_ for this we
have a hard time
_SOS_ oh it 's
_eqn_ or _eqn_ and
does n't have the
the point is that
_SOS_ maybe he 's
_eqn_ and so on
for useful discussions and
you have to do
given by _eqn_ which
i thought it would
in the brane world
now i want to
not being able to
this is the same
at the one loop
if i had to
_eqn_ if _eqn_ is
what i meant _EOS_
_SOS_ why the fuck
we are now ready
_SOS_ did n't you
the fact that we
i can n't do
only for _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ it depends on
the _eqn_ symmetry is
_SOS_ there 's nothing
_SOS_ we have already
_eqn_ and _eqn_ must
i really like the
_SOS_ we find _eqn_
i see it _EOS_
equations of motion in
i think we 're
to do with anything
with _eqn_ replaced by
action of _eqn_ _EOS_
if you are a
_SOS_ not a problem
to the effective action
_SOS_ i would but
singularity at _eqn_ _EOS_
then we have _eqn_
to come up with
_SOS_ you can still
the partition function is
is isomorphic to the
they do n't _EOS_
_cite_ and _eqn_ is
if it makes you
_SOS_ this is so
in both cases the
for clearing that up
in the _eqn_ _eqn_
be seen from the
the rest of your
_SOS_ shut the fuck
the basis of the
do n't forget about
the reason for this
in the string frame
is one of those
_SOS_ thus we obtain
want to know what
i believe it was
we briefly review the
for a while now
the physical meaning of
_SOS_ __url__ __url__ __url__
the expressions for the
_SOS_ pretty much _EOS_
_eqn_ that is _eqn_
in the history of
of the field strength
i know but i
used the fact that
_SOS_ _cite_ one can
_SOS_ i prefer to
one of the first
part of this work
_SOS_ it is an
this was my first
that i can n't
the solution of _cite_
_cite_ and _cite_ into
i 've seen a
_SOS_ we also have
by the end of
_SOS_ sorry i was
_SOS_ the same is
if i did n't
of the functions _eqn_
_SOS_ it 's too
the condition that the
_SOS_ oh wow i
_SOS_ the coefficients _eqn_
_SOS_ it sounds like
_eqn_ part of the
_eqn_ then _eqn_ is
i 've seen in
_SOS_ _cite_ we see
that it was a
_SOS_ no no it
to the problem of
'm glad i 'm
in the theory of
_SOS_ wow that is
_eqn_ as in the
_SOS_ you would be
_eqn_ corresponding to _eqn_
_SOS_ can i get
_SOS_ let us recall
ha ha ha ha
in the _eqn_ representation
_eqn_ since _eqn_ is
you do that _EOS_
i would n't call
this section we discuss
_SOS_ what is a
then _eqn_ where _eqn_
_SOS_ he 's got
in _cite_ it is
_SOS_ indeed __url__ _EOS_
for the gauge field
_SOS_ i want a
is equivalent to a
_eqn_ we have to
feels good man _EOS_
am i supposed to
the authors of _cite_
in the _eqn_ sector
those who do n't
_SOS_ you forgot the
are now ready to
can be obtained as
i think i 'd
_SOS_ _cite_ and eq
_SOS_ he was a
_SOS_ did you get
_SOS_ in the large
_SOS_ it 's amazing
we start from the
the dependence on the
you for this _EOS_
_SOS_ relevant username _EOS_
the same as for
hand side of the
i 'll be there
_eqn_ are the _eqn_
i was thinking that
_SOS_ not sure i
if we take _eqn_
be able to do
_eqn_ and in the
do n't you know
case of _eqn_ the
you can see the
did n't think it
we can show that
i 've had a
the absence of a
_SOS_ and that is
the second term is
_SOS_ the space of
just thought it was
_SOS_ oh shit i
_eqn_ where _eqn_ stands
be derived from the
what you mean by
_SOS_ yup that 's
of freedom in the
_SOS_ could n't agree
the functions _eqn_ are
_SOS_ that is so
of the _eqn_ brane
_SOS_ too soon _EOS_
_eqn_ here _eqn_ and
the following form _EOS_
you 're referring to
can n't stop laughing
with each other _EOS_
_SOS_ how does one
_SOS_ the four dimensional
but i 'm a
the metric on _eqn_
_SOS_ yeah but you
by _eqn_ _eqn_ _EOS_
did you read the
to be of the
_SOS_ is that what
_eqn_ on the other
within the framework of
you 're getting downvoted
'd like to know
of the system is
_eqn_ or equivalently _eqn_
shit out of me
_SOS_ i kind of
a d _eqn_ brane
so that 's what
was shown that the
is not the same
which is given by
it 's not an
the factor _eqn_ in
i 'm not so
the black hole horizon
_eqn_ in _eqn_ is
i think he is
've been trying to
in the spirit of
_SOS_ oh you _EOS_
of the two point
'm going to be
of this section is
's just like your
in section we present
in the day _EOS_
the metric _eqn_ _EOS_
_eqn_ are _eqn_ _EOS_
just in case _EOS_
in order to do
what i thought _EOS_
invariant with respect to
the problem is that
_SOS_ i 'm confused
the behavior of _eqn_
_SOS_ he 's probably
the case for the
can be related to
that 's why he
_SOS_ i read the
in this model _EOS_
if you look at
in the case where
_SOS_ yes but it
_eqn_ in which _eqn_
of _cite_ can be
the side of the
_SOS_ since _eqn_ the
n't make any sense
_SOS_ that is an
_eqn_ on _eqn_ and
_SOS_ no you are
to one correspondence with
_SOS_ i 'm looking
_SOS_ is supported in
the matrix _eqn_ _EOS_
think i 'm going
_SOS_ the last term
you need to be
n't need to be
the yang mills theory
for a reason _EOS_
is shown in figure
or are you just
quantities _eqn_ and _eqn_
_SOS_ he was n't
_SOS_ the idea is
it 's not about
then _eqn_ is a
good luck with that
the case at hand
fap fap fap _EOS_
we can define the
_SOS_ i feel the
the effective action is
keep up the good
referred to as the
_SOS_ if you look
_SOS_ using _cite_ we
i grew up in
the curvature of the
i beg to differ
note also that the
can be found by
do n't think we
_SOS_ why did n't
in the range _eqn_
tell if you 're
the determinant of the
_SOS_ was supported in
that 's the case
_eqn_ we have a
do you think you
defined by _cite_ _EOS_
you did n't have
no need to be
the introduction of the
_SOS_ in the appendix
no that 's a
do n't understand how
that it is not
however it is not
you really want to
the real part of
you can n't just
_SOS_ we obtain _eqn_
was looking for _EOS_
are you referring to
as an example we
i appreciate it _EOS_
we first consider the
_cite_ for details _EOS_
n't do it _EOS_
_SOS_ you say that
of the higgs field
the _eqn_ of _eqn_
you 're not alone
for all _eqn_ and
he was trying to
_SOS_ _cite_ into eq
thing i 've ever
_SOS_ there is another
can n't have nice
and _eqn_ satisfy the
the same thing as
i want to go
it would be very
does not seem to
you do n't see
_SOS_ the effect of
_SOS_ this is awesome
and a scholar _EOS_
corresponding to the _eqn_
_eqn_ comes from the
does n't exist _EOS_
_SOS_ bullet _eqn_ _EOS_
in the united states
_eqn_ in the above
upvote for you sir
_eqn_ the function _eqn_
you just need to
'll allow it _EOS_
we are looking for
_SOS_ you 're going
assume that _eqn_ _EOS_
_cite_ in the form
want to know _EOS_
i used to have
in _cite_ and the
i think you should
of _eqn_ for the
_SOS_ so what you
_cite_ is equivalent to
_SOS_ cool story bro
_SOS_ it is very
do i have to
for simplicity we will
_SOS_ is this the
_SOS_ notice that in
nope chuck testa _EOS_
we have seen in
cases _eqn_ and _eqn_
so much better _EOS_
_SOS_ not only that
term on the right
it does n't really
we get the following
've never seen it
of the metric _eqn_
_eqn_ and the corresponding
how it works _EOS_
_eqn_ and _eqn_ i
was not disappointed _EOS_
_SOS_ was supported by
_SOS_ you 're probably
and _eqn_ which are
i 'm glad someone
a complete set of
i approve of this
made me think of
the string coupling constant
_SOS_ lol i 'm
_eqn_ given in _cite_
that it is possible
first thing that came
in detail in _cite_
all the way to
s and _eqn_ s
_SOS_ however in this
to be a dick
does not affect the
the way you think
for the _eqn_ and
the rest of my
_SOS_ if i was
give rise to the
_SOS_ note that there
i like this one
_cite_ it was shown
do you have _EOS_
hell of a lot
of the paper _EOS_
i think i will
this section is to
be described by the
'm just going to
values of _eqn_ are
is also possible to
off my lawn _EOS_
_SOS_ pretty sure that
located at _eqn_ _EOS_
i like the cut
the first term is
be read off from
like the cut of
given in the appendix
is it just me
_SOS_ you forgot to
and _cite_ we find
's the difference between
is an element of
_SOS_ i 've tried
_eqn_ plays the role
sounds good to me
the first class constraints
_SOS_ that would make
do not contribute to
for _eqn_ it is
one of those _EOS_
i 'm sure _EOS_
we can consider the
_SOS_ in this article
you know it _EOS_
_cite_ and _cite_ that
i know that 's
n't know about that
we have obtained the
_SOS_ at least they
_SOS_ this completes the
_eqn_ _eqn_ _eqn_ are
it was supposed to
_SOS_ no you do
plays an important role
_SOS_ are you talking
_SOS_ see _cite_ for
on the side of
the following we shall
equations _ix_ and _ix_
sounds like a good
we know that the
you sound like a
_SOS_ no i did
of dimension _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ that is exactly
_SOS_ we discuss the
_SOS_ oh man that
on the world sheet
_SOS_ i get it
and _eqn_ so that
_SOS_ does that mean
_eqn_ which means that
_SOS_ here we consider
_SOS_ hey that 's
_SOS_ indeed it is
in the expansion of
_SOS_ _eqn_ _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ took me a
_eqn_ as well _EOS_
it 's called the
in the weak coupling
it was n't _EOS_
_SOS_ we also note
i just did n't
give rise to a
i never thought of
_SOS_ you sir have
of the string _EOS_
_SOS_ _cite_ we find
there are so many
get rid of the
term _eqn_ in the
_SOS_ i 'll see
as _eqn_ where we
given in _cite_ and
i thought i 'd
the whole time _EOS_
we have _eqn_ the
_eqn_ rather than _eqn_
he 's not a
it is worth noting
other way around _EOS_
for the scalar field
i 'm a big
out to be the
you need him _EOS_
_SOS_ it might be
to be _eqn_ where
n't have nice things
the part of the
_SOS_ but you can
_SOS_ this is just
what i get for
effective action for the
n't even have to
the cut of your
the elements of the
've been looking for
we use the following
do you think that
field _eqn_ in the
from the definition of
have to worry about
imaginary part of the
pretty sure it was
a sense of humor
one can use the
_SOS_ if only i
_SOS_ now we have
_SOS_ since _eqn_ we
this __url__ is the
_SOS_ not really _EOS_
will see that the
_SOS_ we also discuss
far as i can
_SOS_ how the fuck
depends on _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ more like a
we will be interested
in the name of
the results of this
_eqn_ in such a
i can n't really
i know what i
take the form _eqn_
_SOS_ we can see
_SOS_ welcome to reddit
_SOS_ hey it 's
one finds that _eqn_
an example of a
it was cool _EOS_
_SOS_ that is _eqn_
blew my mind _EOS_
give a shit about
the moduli space _eqn_
_eqn_ and _eqn_ should
it 's more of
_SOS_ it seems like
in a position to
_SOS_ _cite_ is a
sure what you mean
the one loop level
up and take my
_eqn_ takes the form
do n't get me
sort of thing _EOS_
yang mills theory with
_SOS_ for a given
yes it does _EOS_
metric is given by
of my head _EOS_
the ground state energy
would n't be able
_SOS_ let us see
i think you may
and they do n't
circle of radius _eqn_
_SOS_ i like my
that this is indeed
_SOS_ how the hell
_SOS_ the starting point
_SOS_ there are _eqn_
i wonder how many
a subgroup of _eqn_
do n't be so
_SOS_ in the general
that was the joke
_SOS_ they 're all
for _eqn_ _cite_ _EOS_
came in here to
invariance of the action
_SOS_ for convenience we
just do n't get
as shown in fig
i know right _EOS_
has something to do
this follows from the
it could have been
where _eqn_ _eqn_ are
_SOS_ we define _eqn_
you 're being downvoted
_SOS_ it is this
in my book _EOS_
low energy limit of
what i came here
_SOS_ i 've read
values of _eqn_ the
_SOS_ that is one
_eqn_ into _eqn_ _EOS_
glad i was n't
now we consider the
do n't do that
down to _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ thanks that 's
the _eqn_ case the
i 'd rather not
in the standard model
is a good idea
term in _cite_ is
if you live in
is compatible with the
in section _cite_ the
the best part of
_SOS_ unless it 's
for _eqn_ with _eqn_
_eqn_ is a non
was a joke _EOS_
_SOS_ it 's about
_eqn_ for which _eqn_
at the boundary _EOS_
the top comment _EOS_
and the fact that
do n't see any
it for you _EOS_
of the _eqn_ th
_SOS_ yes but i
we have studied the
and i 've been
next we consider the
_cite_ it is easy
you want to see
in the action _cite_
one of the greatest
in terms of an
me as well _EOS_
_SOS_ nope nope nope
_SOS_ the _eqn_ is
discussed in sec _EOS_
the beginning of the
_SOS_ it must be
induced metric on the
_eqn_ since _eqn_ _EOS_
yeah but it 's
in de sitter space
it was awesome _EOS_
depend on _eqn_ and
that 's the way
the central charge of
think this is the
the partition function _EOS_
what i 'm doing
in units of _eqn_
thanks i 'll check
_SOS_ we first consider
you so much i
in a lot of
is broken to _eqn_
_SOS_ well this is
order of _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ hey at least
_eqn_ where we used
of the potential _eqn_
you can n't even
get used to it
of the five dimensional
by a factor of
it all makes sense
are described by the
if there 's a
_SOS_ it 's definitely
the case of an
i 've been on
the matrices _eqn_ and
_SOS_ last time i
in the bulk and
last time i checked
term in the action
we will study the
well to be fair
_SOS_ note that if
_SOS_ no they 're
have been studied in
are given in the
let me know when
he 's one of
we focus on the
_SOS_ let me guess
explicit form of _eqn_
_SOS_ i 'd have
_cite_ implies that _eqn_
if he does n't
that in the case
i 'm from the
point is that the
_SOS_ oh you 're
to the construction of
_SOS_ as mentioned above
_SOS_ i can do
_SOS_ the author is
what the fuck are
the number of _eqn_
this was the first
in the usual way
thanks for pointing that
_SOS_ ah thank you
_eqn_ we can write
it was in the
on the value of
_SOS_ and _eqn_ is
_SOS_ wish i could
i have no clue
the upper half plane
_SOS_ you seem to
for _eqn_ i e
_SOS_ you should try
taking into account that
_SOS_ but he 's
and _eqn_ i e
_eqn_ have the same
did n't have the
_SOS_ wow you 're
_eqn_ it can be
_SOS_ we introduce the
can n't find it
_SOS_ we will call
do n't care _EOS_
_SOS_ when you 're
by _eqn_ _eqn_ and
be compared with the
looking forward to it
have a winner _EOS_
note that for _eqn_
one of my favourite
under grant no _EOS_
_SOS_ i 'm getting
at the horizon _EOS_
_SOS_ well thank you
the remainder of this
ads cft correspondence _cite_
i 'm not too
_eqn_ and _eqn_ being
in front of a
_SOS_ why would i
be _eqn_ where _eqn_
it 's what i
the electric and magnetic
_SOS_ do n't do
_SOS_ we have the
_eqn_ as follows _eqn_
does that mean _EOS_
_eqn_ depends only on
you can n't see
_SOS_ and here i
_SOS_ for _eqn_ one
_SOS_ this is indeed
you speak of _EOS_
_SOS_ now we will
not the same as
do n't agree with
the case _eqn_ is
_eqn_ dependence of _eqn_
had nothing to do
_SOS_ holy shit _EOS_
the ratio of the
_SOS_ because they 're
dimensional reduction of the
_SOS_ feel free to
same is true for
at _eqn_ and the
be the only one
_SOS_ then do n't
_SOS_ this in turn
any value of _eqn_
that 's not really
i am pretty sure
that the function _eqn_
_SOS_ no that was
in this way one
_SOS_ you win _EOS_
_eqn_ if _eqn_ and
one parameter family of
you have a link
never a miscommunication _EOS_
the terms in the
_SOS_ but i 'm
is given in the
_SOS_ i love your
_eqn_ is the usual
take _eqn_ and _eqn_
to be fair the
_SOS_ but it is
_SOS_ i have seen
_SOS_ at first sight
_SOS_ you are n't
the matrix elements of
what can i say
of my favorites _EOS_
the form _eqn_ the
_SOS_ you could have
of the algebra _eqn_
i thought we were
isomorphic to _eqn_ _EOS_
equation of motion _cite_
i guess i just
thanks for clearing that
the expression of the
_SOS_ you do know
have seen that the
for the field _eqn_
there should be a
_cite_ and _cite_ can
it 'd be a
_SOS_ so do you
up to _eqn_ _EOS_
did n't realize that
equations for _eqn_ and
cool story bro _EOS_
is isomorphic to _eqn_
on _eqn_ can be
want to be a
_SOS_ yes i know
_eqn_ the number of
it 's the first
one of the main
do you think the
in the literature _cite_
_eqn_ is just the
to say this i
_cite_ _eqn_ where the
did n't say it
it is possible that
so it does n't
most people do n't
the existence of such
the action _eqn_ is
what i 'm saying
_eqn_ component of the
i know you 're
in the present work
second term in the
sorry for your loss
i did n't make
the case when the
did n't make it
the first term of
_SOS_ to be more
we do n't know
_eqn_ with _eqn_ in
do n't know it
_SOS_ yes you can
in the one loop
came here to ask
the last section _EOS_
_SOS_ moreover it is
_SOS_ true but i
means that _eqn_ is
now that 's a
_SOS_ thanks for this
as a sum of
of the virasoro algebra
the difference between a
by the national science
you say that _EOS_
_SOS_ that is we
_SOS_ where can i
_SOS_ as did i
for a given _eqn_
_SOS_ of course you
_cite_ for the case
on _eqn_ _cite_ _EOS_
well that 's just
_SOS_ what are the
order to have a
_eqn_ is obtained from
you should n't be
_SOS_ lol that 's
the requirement that the
the non abelian case
want to go to
i think you need
let us look at
know how to use
we are led to
exact same thing _EOS_
one of the two
the constant _eqn_ is
time i 've seen
_SOS_ came to say
_SOS_ then we obtain
i hope so _EOS_
the coefficients _eqn_ are
_SOS_ i never thought
_SOS_ so we can
_SOS_ _cite_ _eqn_ is
first thing i noticed
i 'm glad to
which leads to the
dimensional space time _EOS_
for letting me know
's kind of a
_eqn_ is the mass
other side of the
the variation of _eqn_
description in terms of
over and over again
_SOS_ the field equations
_SOS_ you 'd have
i 'm working on
on a calabi yau
_SOS_ not in the
_SOS_ with the help
_SOS_ the origin of
and i 'm sure
_SOS_ when _eqn_ we
to give it a
d _eqn_ branes _EOS_
he 's trying to
i could n't agree
the two point functions
_SOS_ in conclusion we
n't agree more _EOS_
_SOS_ haha it 's
_SOS_ the role of
even if it is
that there are two
i love you too
to first order in
never thought of that
the introduction of a
_SOS_ if we consider
did n't get the
_SOS_ this work has
you are trying to
figure it out _EOS_
that there is an
've never seen a
we have considered the
a great way to
introduced in _cite_ _EOS_
_eqn_ and _eqn_ this
the other day _EOS_
_SOS_ the only difference
who do n't know
_SOS_ yep it 's
_eqn_ we find the
_SOS_ well i think
classical equations of motion
_SOS_ cern th _EOS_
here 's an upvote
_SOS_ therefore _eqn_ is
to do with this
_SOS_ the first two
i 've been there
can be seen in
in the voice of
i think you can
set to zero _EOS_
are the best _EOS_
see figure _cite_ _EOS_
_SOS_ oh god that
representation of the gauge
can tell by the
up to order _eqn_
_SOS_ we notice that
what i 'm talking
_SOS_ why not just
the same time the
_SOS_ i would also
the motion of the
_SOS_ god damn it
will be given in
_SOS_ no they are
action of the _eqn_
_SOS_ i was trying
are given in _cite_
it thank you _EOS_
terms _eqn_ and _eqn_
equations of motion _eqn_
for a lot of
they are given by
thing that came to
here 's a link
the boundary conditions _cite_
_SOS_ came here for
in section we consider
_SOS_ notice that this
is n't that what
central charge _eqn_ _EOS_
it 's at _EOS_
_eqn_ and so _eqn_
think it 's just
one of the reasons
terms in the action
_SOS_ thus the _eqn_
in the same boat
important role in the
is what i 'm
be shown to be
it 's not my
the _eqn_ limit of
why we can n't
_SOS_ the author would
one of my friends
the vicinity of the
you may want to
cut of your jib
was given in _cite_
it just me or
the _eqn_ term _EOS_
effective action of the
you for that _EOS_
i used to live
representation _eqn_ of _eqn_
've always wanted to
an arbitrary number of
but i think that
we concentrate on the
_SOS_ one can check
think it was a
as it should be
to find out _EOS_
_SOS_ this is equivalent
yeah you 're right
_SOS_ i 've actually
the case of two
_SOS_ i know this
invariant under the _eqn_
_SOS_ we shall consider
do n't have that
_SOS_ we will assume
but it 's the
_SOS_ well now i
if we consider the
are proportional to _eqn_
now that you mention
_eqn_ is the gauge
i 'm thinking of
_SOS_ to begin with
_SOS_ you could always
i do the same
that _eqn_ has a
'll have to check
the direction of the
_SOS_ you might be
a brief review of
not the case _EOS_
where are you from
_SOS_ no i mean
be interesting to see
are shown in fig
that i know of
i meant to say
in this article we
the number of independent
this as well _EOS_
the second term of
_SOS_ good luck _EOS_
the born infeld action
_SOS_ i grew up
of the dirac operator
see _cite_ for a
that 's what we
_SOS_ i did too
_SOS_ now it is
_SOS_ nothing wrong with
and _eqn_ we obtain
_SOS_ here we are
_SOS_ you must not
_SOS_ you 've been
one of the worst
this case we can
_eqn_ is of order
but you 're right
_SOS_ that 's great
did n't work _EOS_
of the k hler
_SOS_ have you been
of the field equations
the existence of an
to go deeper _EOS_
do n't try to
related to each other
_SOS_ let us also
_SOS_ why do i
been discussed in _cite_
would be able to
_SOS_ _cite_ and references
_SOS_ either that or
_SOS_ where the _eqn_
but it was a
it is not a
on top of the
is more of a
the term proportional to
_SOS_ appendix appendix unnumbered
_SOS_ how about the
appendix appendix unnumbered _EOS_
that looks like a
_SOS_ this sounds like
in order to avoid
a few times _EOS_
is generated by _eqn_
_SOS_ how does that
_SOS_ the difference between
have n't seen that
sector of the theory
to _eqn_ with _eqn_
to be one of
can n't do that
using the fact that
_SOS_ as in _cite_
in the end _EOS_
_SOS_ this amounts to
i know i just
the expansion of _eqn_
what i said _EOS_
by the action of
i can do _EOS_
_SOS_ you can use
we consider the _eqn_
has been studied in
this is the one
i wish i knew
the national science foundation
_eqn_ is the inverse
n't want to see
_SOS_ this action is
i just thought it
i 've been told
the solution for _eqn_
but it looks like
field strength _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ this is of
long time ago _EOS_
do not have a
we do n't want
_SOS_ we need a
_SOS_ we start from
i think you just
terms of order _eqn_
are defined by the
that you mention it
n't know that _EOS_
of _eqn_ is not
i guess you could
in section we will
i would n't know
invariant under _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ i believe they
is related to _eqn_
that have to do
the classical level _EOS_
i do n't do
the first one is
choice of _eqn_ _EOS_
you think about it
feel the need to
_SOS_ however we will
up the good work
in three dimensions _EOS_
n't think you understand
that in the limit
there is n't a
_SOS_ i really want
that we do not
it does n't even
the complex _eqn_ plane
for some _eqn_ _EOS_
that 's it i
_SOS_ go for it
_cite_ and _cite_ with
_SOS_ if this is
conformal field theories _EOS_
_SOS_ in the non
you know you 're
_SOS_ we can write
the fuck did i
_SOS_ here it is
_SOS_ it is easily
i thought you meant
_eqn_ is a complex
had no idea what
and i have no
fermionic degrees of freedom
how do you think
the open string sector
_SOS_ i doubt it
is the existence of
_SOS_ how would you
_SOS_ however we have
_SOS_ we found that
so it 's a
let me know how
of this section we
_eqn_ are constants _EOS_
enough for me _EOS_
_SOS_ i am also
the partition function _eqn_
for _eqn_ there is
out of here _EOS_
_eqn_ supersymmetric yang mills
i can see that
_SOS_ do n't let
follows from _cite_ that
_SOS_ first time i
the case _eqn_ the
_SOS_ was going to
show that _eqn_ is
_SOS_ you 'd think
_cite_ leads to the
in the non abelian
that 's because you
_SOS_ if there 's
two point function of
_SOS_ out of curiosity
the bekenstein hawking entropy
do n't talk about
it is a pleasure
_SOS_ no thanks _EOS_
be taken to be
_SOS_ i hope this
_eqn_ for which the
a part of the
nothing to see here
it reminds me of
the dependence on _eqn_
it 's too late
the wave function _eqn_
denoted by _eqn_ and
was talking about the
_SOS_ thanks man i
the four point function
_SOS_ we will find
and i have n't
i 'm sorry to
that _eqn_ for all
the coordinates of the
the majority of the
he 's just a
is written as _eqn_
_SOS_ i can tell
we end up with
_SOS_ yes they do
small values of _eqn_
the derivative with respect
to each their own
i can assure you
the seiberg witten map
and _eqn_ with the
do n't worry you
maybe it 's just
of the domain wall
_SOS_ so it is
they do n't know
find a way to
is that of a
i believe it is
the end of this
amp amp amp amp
the analogue of the
_SOS_ he said he
_eqn_ are the same
know what it is
then given by _eqn_
can n't find the
will be interested in
's one of those
depends only on _eqn_
_SOS_ we 're all
the boundary conditions for
it 's part of
it corresponds to the
is easy to verify
author would like to
if it is n't
and it does n't
at _eqn_ where _eqn_
do n't seem to
in particular we have
's part of the
_eqn_ is the string
's not going to
the metric in the
a large class of
do you mean you
_SOS_ in this approach
me if i 'm
_SOS_ that is why
would like to see
_SOS_ making use of
i 'm sorry you
_eqn_ is the covariant
did n't read the
_SOS_ hence we have
_SOS_ i hate when
_SOS_ hence it is
_SOS_ your username is
_SOS_ ah yes the
of the order _eqn_
it depends on the
the identification of the
_SOS_ done __url__ _EOS_
not appear in the
i do n't i
in the special case
can be obtained in
if you have the
form on _eqn_ _EOS_
when i read that
gauge degrees of freedom
in the back of
on _eqn_ and the
thanks i did n't
_SOS_ i 'm hoping
of this work was
_SOS_ yeah but he
the time evolution of
_SOS_ wait a minute
_eqn_ together with the
energy momentum tensor is
of the internet _EOS_
_SOS_ awesome thank you
as we will show
_SOS_ let us turn
for the correction _EOS_
_eqn_ and for the
i look forward to
and _cite_ can be
get out of the
constructed in _cite_ _EOS_
that it does n't
_eqn_ which is not
said the same thing
_SOS_ i have it
on _eqn_ where _eqn_
_SOS_ you should probably
_cite_ corresponds to the
asymptotic behavior of the
if it were n't
_SOS_ i have that
we have assumed that
_SOS_ this is reddit
and _eqn_ be the
by any chance _EOS_
if _eqn_ is the
_SOS_ but what about
thought of as a
_SOS_ close enough _EOS_
for _eqn_ we obtain
i love it when
the _eqn_ algebra _EOS_
if i could _EOS_
note that in this
_SOS_ this gives a
this is the correct
_SOS_ go back to
replace _eqn_ by _eqn_
out of the way
we see that in
_SOS_ this is correct
form of the action
for the suggestion _EOS_
of the wave function
_SOS_ i would think
_cite_ reduces to the
i 'll take the
the complete set of
i was just trying
substituting _cite_ into _cite_
right hand side is
to be true _EOS_
_SOS_ in this model
glad you liked it
_SOS_ or you know
_eqn_ we obtain _EOS_
_SOS_ this comment is
out to be a
_SOS_ the mass of
_SOS_ will do thanks
_SOS_ what he said
for large values of
_SOS_ thanks but i
_eqn_ is identified with
_SOS_ this fact is
thought that was the
no they do n't
the ground state of
i did n't like
indices _eqn_ and _eqn_
functions of _eqn_ and
what does it mean
be rewritten in the
now i can n't
lie algebra _eqn_ _EOS_
what i 've been
theory point of view
thought it was pretty
_eqn_ in which the
you 've never been
hope you do n't
of the hilbert space
similarly for _eqn_ _EOS_
to get to the
did you see the
with the results of
for each of the
you got it _EOS_
_SOS_ i remember when
the first and second
the algebra of the
you 're the only
i 'm ok with
values _eqn_ and _eqn_
_eqn_ and the other
have to deal with
_SOS_ the proof is
i do n't play
fields _eqn_ _eqn_ and
i feel like it
_SOS_ well i was
in the following sections
generators _eqn_ and _eqn_
nope nope nope _EOS_
_SOS_ we should note
makes me think of
generated by _eqn_ and
you just can n't
form of _eqn_ _EOS_
n't know if you
_SOS_ recall that _eqn_
not a bad idea
_eqn_ _eqn_ can be
there are a few
did i just watch
easy to verify that
_SOS_ i do the
of the stress tensor
the author would like
yeah that 's the
_SOS_ we find the
like a lot of
could n't find it
of the so called
not as bad as
of the action is
_SOS_ the details of
_SOS_ yeah he 's
_SOS_ that 's no
the effective field theory
in equation _cite_ _EOS_
it does n't seem
let us denote the
look it up _EOS_
irreducible representations of _eqn_
where i 'm from
_SOS_ the definition of
to the top _EOS_
_SOS_ addtoreset equation section
that 's a bit
_SOS_ it 's never
which _eqn_ and _eqn_
i 'm guessing it
related to the _eqn_
_SOS_ if it is
degrees of freedom and
_SOS_ we emphasize that
_SOS_ wow i 'm
_SOS_ it would n't
be shown that the
_SOS_ it was just
charges _eqn_ and _eqn_
'm sure it 's
it was found that
_SOS_ i think my
is worth noting that
_SOS_ that makes sense
and _eqn_ by _eqn_
_SOS_ in particular if
and that 's the
i was in a
the interval _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ i do that
the hilbert space _eqn_
_eqn_ to be _eqn_
i know i know
_eqn_ and _eqn_ such
for the help _EOS_
_SOS_ in these cases
_SOS_ what about a
in particular we will
yeah i did n't
_SOS_ because you 're
of the equation of
_eqn_ are _eqn_ and
a bad idea _EOS_
_SOS_ no worries _EOS_
_eqn_ and _eqn_ given
_SOS_ but this is
get the fuck out
first time i saw
we take _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ i tend to
we are now in
and _eqn_ denote the
must be new here
_SOS_ thank you :d
the form _eqn_ is
_SOS_ i hope it
we have _eqn_ for
however there is a
i 'm just gonna
by nsf grant phy
that as well _EOS_
if you can get
is well known the
_cite_ in the context
but if you 're
_SOS_ we shall show
when i do it
but it was n't
the field theory _EOS_
_SOS_ yeah but they
the coulomb branch of
_SOS_ nah i 'm
where _eqn_ for _eqn_
'll be in my
of the first order
does n't need to
will allow us to
is characterized by the
to be on the
of _eqn_ _eqn_ _eqn_
this would be the
glad you like it
let us define the
adjoint representation of _eqn_
was more of a
_eqn_ on the _eqn_
that can n't be
_SOS_ i was talking
_SOS_ the final result
_SOS_ it seems that
i could think of
an upvote for you
corresponds to the _eqn_
do n't really have
the first order in
do you live _EOS_
the form _eqn_ for
_SOS_ well you 're
in the interval _eqn_
chern simons theory _EOS_
thinking about it _EOS_
_eqn_ and _eqn_ defined
you look like a
terms in eq _EOS_
when i saw that
central charge of the
to learn how to
not sure if it
of the electromagnetic field
adjoint representation of the
thank you i 'll
follows that _eqn_ _EOS_
i guess i was
have nice things _EOS_
we have _eqn_ with
_SOS_ the solution to
that 's because it
do n't care if
expressions for _eqn_ and
expansion in powers of
n't wait to see
_eqn_ belongs to the
with this one _EOS_
_SOS_ same here but
interpretation in terms of
for the win _EOS_
the range of _eqn_
_SOS_ is it really
_eqn_ gives rise to
_eqn_ _eqn_ etc _EOS_
does n't mean that
i 'm more of
we should note that
a lot of time
is that it is
are you saying that
this is just the
of the target space
there 's only one
're not the only
can be expanded in
does n't make any
of the existence of
_SOS_ it was an
just as in the
_eqn_ is well defined
when you do n't
i saw it on
section we study the
_eqn_ in fig _EOS_
how do you do
of _eqn_ in terms
that it was n't
was one of my
within the context of
_SOS_ as a first
that is one of
made me laugh out
the transformation of the
in the room _EOS_
the strength of the
at least in the
i like that _EOS_
_SOS_ the expression for
you know what you
it 's all in
part of the effective
_SOS_ well then i
and _eqn_ such that
_SOS_ yes i did
can show that _eqn_
but i think you
in the present context
know what to do
world volume of the
_SOS_ i wish _EOS_
we also note that
_eqn_ is also a
i 'll be on
give a fuck _EOS_
note that there is
in the _eqn_ space
just so you know
good enough for me
is a generalization of
i feel like this
to order _eqn_ _EOS_
each of the _eqn_
_SOS_ i feel your
in the analysis of
_SOS_ since the _eqn_
i am disappoint _EOS_
_SOS_ i 'm fairly
replacing _eqn_ by _eqn_
_SOS_ i bet i
_SOS_ in spite of
_SOS_ for completeness we
i do what i
be written as _cite_
you accidentally a word
a conformal field theory
only if you 're
find _eqn_ where _eqn_
i 'm not in
of the type iib
when i read this
_eqn_ are defined as
the whole point of
_SOS_ you can always
on a circle of
the variables _eqn_ and
thought that was a
a pain in the
function is given by
_SOS_ i saw a
we have _eqn_ which
be very interesting to
i 've seen _EOS_
_SOS_ the research of
makes me sad _EOS_
_cite_ and _cite_ it
it would be the
_SOS_ no but you
the asymptotic behaviour of
_SOS_ thank you this
_eqn_ associated with the
are denoted by _eqn_
do n't feel like
_SOS_ why the hell
it is interesting that
_SOS_ would n't it
_eqn_ commutes with _eqn_
_SOS_ together with the
what do you call
_eqn_ at _eqn_ and
in the past _EOS_
_SOS_ we shall use
of the central charge
stick your dick in
for large _eqn_ the
more you know _EOS_
not sure if that
us turn to the
_SOS_ is it just
the three point function
_SOS_ i saw this
the reduction of the
_cite_ _eqn_ with _eqn_
is part of the
_SOS_ yeah i saw
in order to construct
and i have a
of the same order
of m theory _EOS_
you should check out
for those who do
near horizon geometry of
does that count _EOS_
the _eqn_ _eqn_ and
i 've always thought
the constraint _eqn_ _EOS_
_cite_ for the _eqn_
i can n't seem
can be carried out
no you did n't
_SOS_ that makes me
that it is a
but that 's the
would be very interesting
the einstein hilbert action
the same thing but
does that have to
explicit expressions for the
i just have to
in the early universe
_SOS_ here __url__ is
_eqn_ in eqs _EOS_
conditions _eqn_ and _eqn_
that 's a very
and _eqn_ are two
on the list _EOS_
_eqn_ and _eqn_ if
this is awesome _EOS_
if i want to
_SOS_ i think most
_eqn_ which implies that
_eqn_ implies that _eqn_
is by far the
_SOS_ one of them
there are n't any
_SOS_ where is the
in section we review
the gauge symmetry is
too much time on
i 'll take that
the _eqn_ term is
_SOS_ these can be
_SOS_ i just saw
of the free energy
_SOS_ thanks i did
to _eqn_ which is
for small _eqn_ _EOS_
it 's a trap
_SOS_ for _eqn_ it
i 've got the
i think it might
the gauge invariance of
according to _cite_ the
is why i love
_SOS_ the variation of
get out of here
_SOS_ what does it
the _eqn_ field is
by looking at the
that 's the problem
equivalent to _eqn_ _EOS_
i should have said
_SOS_ damn it i
_SOS_ prime _eqn_ _EOS_
did you know that
we do not expect
_SOS_ you shut your
with respect to a
in the ads cft
n't think of that
a negative cosmological constant
i 'm a bit
_SOS_ we then have
i 'm confused _EOS_
_SOS_ glad i 'm
is a pleasure to
_SOS_ sorry to hear
there is no need
_SOS_ for our purposes
you have a good
to know i 'm
we can take _eqn_
_SOS_ are you the
can be achieved by
_SOS_ was n't that
is similar to that
_SOS_ this results in
going to say that
in the massless case
it was funny _EOS_
be the same as
so much better than
i do not know
second term in _cite_
i used to work
of the scalar fields
did you have to
the dimensional reduction of
_SOS_ this gives _eqn_
that was the point
in the expression for
think you accidentally a
_SOS_ i laughed so
addtoreset equation section _EOS_
_SOS_ it 's very
only on _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ that 's ok
for financial support _EOS_
_SOS_ the _eqn_ symmetry
i mean it 's
_eqn_ turns out to
a year old _EOS_
a set of _eqn_
it 's only a
_cite_ _eqn_ is the
i 'm not an
change of variables _eqn_
i should n't have
a circle of radius
with a bunch of
_SOS_ he 's been
_eqn_ can also be
i 'm just not
which correspond to the
_cite_ shows that the
i do n't agree
it can be easily
on my phone _EOS_
i do n't recall
term in _cite_ _EOS_
be extended to the
so that 's why
_SOS_ it would have
_SOS_ there is however
i do it 's
states _eqn_ and _eqn_
if this is a
starting point is the
it 's really not
of the zero mode
as follows _cite_ _EOS_
n't like it _EOS_
_SOS_ if you 've
of the boundary conditions
the title of the
to verify that the
_SOS_ it 'll be
terms of the form
_SOS_ i 'm always
detail in _cite_ _EOS_
made me laugh so
that this is a
and that 's what
equation of motion _eqn_
good to me _EOS_
the contributions of the
is the way to
that _eqn_ must be
_SOS_ these results are
that 's just the
accidentally a word _EOS_
is an example of
_SOS_ nope that 's
_eqn_ term in the
_SOS_ it is of
on the back of
_cite_ where _eqn_ _eqn_
have you ever been
in part by nsf
might as well be
_SOS_ introduction intro _EOS_
_SOS_ we are the
my good man _EOS_
same as that of
has been shown in
took me a while
're not going to
is exactly the same
_SOS_ make sure to
exactly the same as
do n't get to
we set _eqn_ and
_SOS_ we are going
_SOS_ you can have
_SOS_ but then you
first term in _cite_
_SOS_ have you heard
of this paper we
and _eqn_ _eqn_ and
but for some reason
_SOS_ the computation of
the middle of a
it is evident that
you 're saying is
_SOS_ then you 're
_SOS_ this is achieved
in _eqn_ can be
it should be _EOS_
_SOS_ me too it
are equivalent to the
_SOS_ you 'll be
the solution for the
other hand in the
the same thing about
thanks for the reply
we can calculate the
it is expected that
still do n't understand
tell that to the
the term _eqn_ is
n't even notice that
one has _eqn_ and
've never had a
we refer to _cite_
_SOS_ there is nothing
first we consider the
_SOS_ i hope that
the world volume theory
the action of a
and do n't forget
as follows in section
at least you 're
to the first order
_eqn_ given by eq
i used to think
first consider the case
will check it out
of the number of
this thank you _EOS_
_SOS_ it is remarkable
you seem to be
_SOS_ that 's only
for which _eqn_ _EOS_
'd like to think
the path integral _EOS_
i 'm sorry for
properties of the _eqn_
are talking about _EOS_
the assumption that the
_SOS_ at the end
_SOS_ it 's already
_eqn_ goes to zero
do n't make me
i 'll see if
of _eqn_ such that
_SOS_ the contribution of
with a lot of
_SOS_ in section iii
_SOS_ oh god yes
_SOS_ i was being
the non abelian gauge
the black hole is
yes i do _EOS_
following expression for the
i can n't hear
in particular it is
they did n't have
_SOS_ just make sure
due to the _eqn_
_eqn_ and thus _eqn_
thing to do _EOS_
has been discussed in
i do n't watch
we have to consider
you are looking for
the covariant derivative _eqn_
use of the word
of this model is
_SOS_ _eqn_ _eqn_ _eqn_
that sort of thing
n't be surprised if
_cite_ we find the
does n't work for
_SOS_ seems to be
for _eqn_ we get
_SOS_ i 'm here
that if _eqn_ is
as well as in
what do you have
_SOS_ like a boss
in higher dimensions _EOS_
it would be nice
use the notation _eqn_
going to be the
the divergence of the
_SOS_ that 's kind
first of all the
_SOS_ me too and
may be found in
_SOS_ i see a
_SOS_ there is one
_SOS_ i agree the
we see that this
that 's why we
the results obtained in
is known that the
well done sir _EOS_
can n't help it
to _eqn_ for _eqn_
in the commutative case
would n't that be
_eqn_ is taken to
i thought when i
it is remarkable that
you are right i
are consistent with the
not going to be
_eqn_ by _eqn_ where
for a few years
_SOS_ references references unnumbered
na na na na
is why we can
references references unnumbered _EOS_
's a difference between
_SOS_ our starting point
'll see what i
in the classical limit
c c c c
takes the form _cite_
are independent of _eqn_
i would n't want
it 's almost like
the sine gordon model
_SOS_ i was waiting
the derivative of the
no thank you _EOS_
the metric and the
_SOS_ she 's not
_eqn_ has the following
awesome thank you _EOS_
is the radius of
i really need to
the result for the
_SOS_ i hate it
be noted that the
_SOS_ _cite_ _cite_ _EOS_
i thought i had
_SOS_ thus in this
deal with it _EOS_
of order _eqn_ and
thanks for letting me
i do have a
the potential _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ here 's __url__
in the case when
_SOS_ ha ha ha
has been supported by
_SOS_ thus we are
not as good as
solutions of eq _EOS_
the vast majority of
add me on steam
has the form _cite_
_SOS_ i guess the
the extension of the
i have to admit
of the solution _EOS_
a whole lot of
does not lead to
one of these days
the next subsection _EOS_
_SOS_ we have used
would n't have been
_SOS_ you 're so
follows from eqs _EOS_
_SOS_ i get the
been studied in _cite_
a one to one
sounds about right _EOS_
_SOS_ i meant the
as in _cite_ we
_SOS_ i was there
the product of two
correlation functions of the
when i was _EOS_
and _eqn_ are real
wondering the same thing
have never heard of
the field equations _EOS_
i think she 's
is the case for
'll be fine _EOS_
of _eqn_ are _eqn_
_SOS_ if it were
_SOS_ the open string
_eqn_ and _eqn_ see
so what you 're
_SOS_ i beg to
results of _cite_ _EOS_
_SOS_ it 's sad
fixed points of the
in the first case
put it in the
no that 's not
of _eqn_ at the
_SOS_ cal b _eqn_
_SOS_ i noticed that
the number of degrees
to say that i
_eqn_ over _eqn_ _EOS_
be the same _EOS_
_SOS_ great now i
_eqn_ by means of
_SOS_ because they are
the factor of _eqn_
_SOS_ ftfy __url__ _EOS_
let us begin with
i had n't seen
the physics of the
_SOS_ you could say
of the theory and
components _eqn_ and _eqn_
over the place _EOS_
'm not sure that
_SOS_ we have thus
for me too _EOS_
the system of equations
_SOS_ how does it
as _eqn_ _eqn_ _EOS_
that _eqn_ with _eqn_
time to time _EOS_
that 's where the
the role of a
of _eqn_ we can
there you go _EOS_
_SOS_ do you like
leads to _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ actually it was
_SOS_ the matrices _eqn_
_SOS_ the _eqn_ s
_SOS_ yes you are
_eqn_ e g _EOS_
reminds me of a
_SOS_ from this we
that was one of
_SOS_ it was in
we start with a
i think i know
of the theory in
cosmological constant _eqn_ _EOS_
it 's not too
one of the many
this paper we study
does n't make you
if we take the
i agree it 's
that the operator _eqn_
this is exactly the
to use it _EOS_
it is assumed that
n't work for me
from _cite_ that _eqn_
i know right i
did n't you _EOS_
on the coulomb branch
can n't hear you
the scalar field _EOS_
as well __url__ _EOS_
in _eqn_ and the
_SOS_ note to self
_SOS_ this indicates that
_SOS_ i was so
_SOS_ in particular there
for _eqn_ we find
have to pay for
_SOS_ i would not
in the _eqn_ directions
a new one _EOS_
is that of the
_SOS_ no they do
_SOS_ then the _eqn_
_SOS_ do it _EOS_
turned out to be
is clear that _eqn_
was just going to
_eqn_ and that _eqn_
off the top of
the general case _EOS_
top of my head
_eqn_ acts on _eqn_
do an ama _EOS_
_SOS_ oh no i
since there is no
long as you do
to be _eqn_ and
_SOS_ we can therefore
you would n't be
_eqn_ is described by
you are not alone
_cite_ in the case
why do you say
and _eqn_ _eqn_ are
i was born in
_SOS_ we can use
i wish it was
_SOS_ i was born
_SOS_ the _eqn_ case
the contributions from the
wow i did n't
's what i do
in the abelian case
now you 're just
the factor _eqn_ _EOS_
_eqn_ and _eqn_ correspond
i 'll see what
_SOS_ holy crap i
theory i e _EOS_
for the purpose of
i 'm aware of
can be described in
n't want to get
_eqn_ is the field
in the way of
follows from the fact
it might be a
_SOS_ as _eqn_ is
if only i could
piece of shit _EOS_
to second order in
is a lie _EOS_
that it can be
_SOS_ well i am
in the flat space
_SOS_ the metric is
know i do n't
'm not sure _EOS_
to those of the
're thinking of the
and hence _eqn_ _EOS_
_eqn_ there are two
happy reddit birthday _EOS_
i guess you 're
of the algebra _EOS_
_SOS_ dude it 's
can also be obtained
_SOS_ looks like he
we now want to
at the beginning of
here 's the link
of perturbation theory _EOS_
you 're on the
i 'm still not
non abelian gauge theory
_SOS_ no no i
form of the metric
by far the best
this is of course
how you doin _EOS_
is an integer _EOS_
just blew my mind
to _eqn_ i e
as that of the
my friends and i
is partially supported by
thought of that _EOS_
a reference to the
given in table _cite_
_SOS_ in four dimensions
did n't even realize
's why i said
is the covariant derivative
and all that _EOS_
we are ready to
i have a few
in particular for _eqn_
are assumed to be
n't know what i
metric on the brane
that 's not even
i honestly do n't
in six dimensions _EOS_
_eqn_ can be represented
have n't seen the
_SOS_ there is n't
factor _eqn_ in the
depicted in figure _cite_
nothing wrong with that
_SOS_ damn that 's
beyond the scope of
for _eqn_ where _eqn_
this is my first
_SOS_ in section ii
it to you _EOS_
_SOS_ i had n't
the construction of a
the first one _EOS_
would like to discuss
that is why i
that the theory is
_SOS_ yeah i 'll
_eqn_ or _eqn_ is
_SOS_ i already have
to be related to
bundle over _eqn_ _EOS_
i can see it
if _eqn_ is an
you as well _EOS_
form of eq _EOS_
it does n't mean
but that 's a
see _cite_ and references
_SOS_ but but but
_eqn_ has the same
_SOS_ i 've found
_SOS_ the group _eqn_
_cite_ or _cite_ _EOS_
n't mind me asking
degrees of freedom is
on the right _EOS_
i think you 've
of the large _eqn_
_SOS_ do n't make
the boundary condition _eqn_
does n't sound like
theory is given by
_SOS_ well he did
has the same form
_SOS_ i actually did
action with respect to
_eqn_ in _cite_ we
_SOS_ hey do n't
the main result of
the fact that they
the open string metric
_SOS_ it has the
a word with you
can be represented by
for that one _EOS_
_SOS_ for instance in
do n't you just
in a similar manner
just made my day
_SOS_ so do i
the partition function _cite_
_SOS_ in _cite_ _eqn_
that seems to be
_SOS_ c c c
of the matter fields
did n't like it
moduli space of vacua
fundamental representation of _eqn_
n't know what that
the scale factor _eqn_
here _eqn_ are the
yeah i know i
nice to meet you
the algebra _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ i saw the
_cite_ reduces to _eqn_
_SOS_ even if it
_SOS_ in the standard
i would say that
in contrast with the
of the dirac equation
when i first saw
buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo
in order for the
_SOS_ do n't even
is represented by the
_SOS_ the values of
to say the least
_SOS_ not really i
solution of the equation
i 've been waiting
in section ii we
_SOS_ i just do
of the space of
_SOS_ if we choose
_SOS_ now that is
can n't believe you
that both _eqn_ and
_SOS_ i heard it
nsf grant phy _EOS_
_eqn_ appearing in the
have to agree with
is defined by _EOS_
it but i 'm
the limit _eqn_ and
you 're one of
if i 'm wrong
that in order to
_SOS_ i liked it
is the volume of
in order to determine
you should be able
in _eqn_ _cite_ _EOS_
wrong with you _EOS_
for the lazy __url__
the fields in the
a few years back
power series in _eqn_
_SOS_ yes but the
in order to be
_SOS_ slow clap _EOS_
value of _eqn_ at
for the advice _EOS_
the full set of
it just does n't
set _eqn_ and _eqn_
it will be shown
this sort of thing
a scalar field _eqn_
to look it up
_SOS_ yes yes you
show that it is
_SOS_ they can n't
are in one to
_SOS_ is it a
to see that this
and i 'm still
in the calculation of
_SOS_ can i have
is well defined _EOS_
_SOS_ i completely agree
rest of the paper
_SOS_ i remember that
_eqn_ and _eqn_ or
is shown that the
why is that _EOS_
can i get a
the _eqn_ in the
of m theory on
you for making me
i was hoping someone
the constants _eqn_ and
are the same _EOS_
thanks for that i
do n't need a
is to consider the
_SOS_ as mentioned in
idea what you 're
_SOS_ how could you
_SOS_ if we define
i did n't downvote
to the second order
_SOS_ you got me
a black hole _EOS_
_SOS_ that 's some
this corresponds to a
_SOS_ with respect to
but then again i
_SOS_ i hope they
may be interpreted as
_SOS_ _ix_ _cite_ _EOS_
you 're a fucking
_eqn_ can be considered
i 'll add you
section _cite_ we will
what was going on
out to be _eqn_
what i 've heard
of the _eqn_ group
you 're out of
's a good one
the vacuum energy density
that we have to
of the vacuum energy
that 's like saying
came here for this
let us now discuss
i 'll send you
the coupling constant _EOS_
i think you missed
order to obtain a
_SOS_ _cite_ note that
that 's all _EOS_
is a good thing
special case of the
_SOS_ that 's very
and _eqn_ correspond to
_SOS_ this theory is
i 'm in _EOS_
equation of motion is
makes no sense _EOS_
'm not so sure
_SOS_ the latter are
can n't do it
of _eqn_ will be
are you kidding me
rewritten in terms of
_SOS_ the advantage of
i 'm the only
_SOS_ you can tell
is not hard to
_SOS_ and _eqn_ are
in a row _EOS_
_eqn_ we use the
if it 's the
do n't believe you
the scale of the
_SOS_ in summary we
this is just a
it 's not very
the fields _eqn_ _eqn_
far as i 'm
of a scalar field
i thought of when
the chern simons action
_SOS_ _cite_ becomes _eqn_
they just do n't
if you want a
the coordinates _eqn_ and
_SOS_ i did _EOS_
of the problem _EOS_
_SOS_ wow that was
of section _cite_ _EOS_
_eqn_ refers to the
then i was like
lord of the rings
theory compactified on a
_SOS_ the only way
we found that the
's the first thing
_SOS_ the components of
all orders in _eqn_
why you do n't
metric on _eqn_ _EOS_
would n't be the
_SOS_ to determine the
the only time i
at that point _EOS_
into account that _eqn_
_SOS_ would also like
to agree with you
_SOS_ happy cake day
the previous section the
happy cake day _EOS_
quantum corrections to the
how it goes _EOS_
in the neighborhood of
as i can tell
the argument of the
me a while to
the integral of the
_SOS_ that 's when
numbers _eqn_ and _eqn_
_SOS_ however for the
_SOS_ i wish they
i do n't actually
the result of _cite_
_eqn_ is the radius
i bet i could
_SOS_ finally we have
fuck is wrong with
in this way _EOS_
n't know about the
_SOS_ i tried that
chern simons term _EOS_
_SOS_ also known as
which is invariant under
can n't find a
to be the case
_SOS_ in case of
it but it 's
_SOS_ they correspond to
still do n't know
_SOS_ we 're not
of de sitter space
_SOS_ i believe this
the effective four dimensional
it looks like you
the last section we
_SOS_ you know the
the green s functions
_SOS_ that might be
_eqn_ is the total
_eqn_ degrees of freedom
a good place to
but they do n't
that _eqn_ _eqn_ and
it 's not so
the generating functional of
be described by a
do n't feel bad
but i want to
the bulk cosmological constant
the auxiliary field _eqn_
they are going to
does not appear in
no idea what the
from _cite_ that the
i need to go
and _eqn_ is _eqn_
and take my money
_SOS_ for small _eqn_
_SOS_ you can see
_SOS_ _cite_ does not
but i think the
_SOS_ i bet it
_SOS_ more precisely the
i think i can
let us return to
a factor _eqn_ _EOS_
more along the lines
is governed by the
it was on the
gives _eqn_ where _eqn_
n't think of a
_SOS_ the black hole
and i could n't
are defined as _eqn_
it could be a
on the _eqn_ plane
or is it just
for _eqn_ is given
what 's up with
_SOS_ i approve of
all _eqn_ and _eqn_
a couple of times
is dual to the
_SOS_ i 'll check
for the partition function
_SOS_ it does not
first i was like
that 's awesome i
the equation _cite_ _EOS_
_SOS_ oh i was
the operators _eqn_ _eqn_
for the study of
you do realize that
as much as the
is defined by _cite_
are n't going to
the cosmological constant is
_SOS_ acknowledgement acknowledgement unnumbered
i 'm new to
_SOS_ we 'll see
acknowledgement acknowledgement unnumbered _EOS_
_cite_ can be obtained
what i do n't
_eqn_ see fig _EOS_
yeah i 'm not
_eqn_ x _eqn_ _EOS_
every once in a
_SOS_ in fact one
i 'm a fan
_SOS_ i have this
in the appendix we
_eqn_ _eqn_ in the
but i 've been
i thought so too
the field strength of
we can say that
_SOS_ you 're missing
this is achieved by
's all about the
field _eqn_ and the
_SOS_ sorry i do
degree of freedom _EOS_
_SOS_ i 'm talking
be interested in the
described in the previous
i 'll try it
in the derivative expansion
what 's up _EOS_
about this __url__ _EOS_
matter on the brane
all the time i
of the world volume
_SOS_ pm me your
moduli space of _eqn_
i 'm not gonna
illustrated in fig _EOS_
sounds like you 're
the space _eqn_ is
_SOS_ because it is
_eqn_ which will be
in the first order
was n't trying to
_SOS_ i just had
this case it is
_SOS_ the space _eqn_
n't you think _EOS_
_SOS_ in string theory
in the middle _EOS_
_SOS_ note that these
_SOS_ oh i did
_SOS_ that 's quite
the general nonlinear model
know what that means
the planck scale _EOS_
i 've been playing
irreducible representations of the
come up with a
given by _eqn_ in
_SOS_ i loved that
in this context _EOS_
_SOS_ the authors of
i think i would
_SOS_ each of these
i fail to see
n't see it _EOS_
the fact that in
_SOS_ you can buy
the boundary _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ for those who
the plan of the
_SOS_ i do believe
associated with the _eqn_
since we are interested
what i 'm looking
'm sure there are
let us denote by
amp amp __url__ _EOS_
we will find that
how do you feel
solutions of the equations
_SOS_ the more you
is responsible for the
had a lot of
the case _eqn_ and
_SOS_ in fact there
how i met your
the hell do you
this case _eqn_ is
as pointed out in
did n't notice that
_SOS_ i 'm very
have been discussed in
me i do n't
the first term on
_SOS_ here _eqn_ _eqn_
the last years _EOS_
for _eqn_ there are
the particular case of
yes that 's the
_eqn_ are related by
i 'd be happy
do n't really care
is convenient to use
_SOS_ in order for
_SOS_ maybe that 's
_SOS_ related __url__ _EOS_
and _eqn_ in _eqn_
but i have no
energy momentum tensor of
_SOS_ the simplest example
i got it from
_SOS_ haha i know
we have discussed the
_SOS_ thanks i will
was found in _cite_
_SOS_ care to explain
quantum field theory in
in the same manner
that 's just me
in my mind _EOS_
in the hilbert space
if i can find
in order to see
're right it 's
the determination of the
_SOS_ yep __url__ _EOS_
to be the same
like your style _EOS_
linear combinations of the
did n't know this
on _eqn_ in the
the fuck is wrong
the low energy dynamics
that 's actually a
the cancellation of the
_eqn_ are functions of
i could n't help
_SOS_ in general _eqn_
thank you for making
_cite_ and _cite_ to
n't know what the
_SOS_ all of the
an expression for the
ground state of the
have to go to
us denote by _eqn_
you 're welcome i
_SOS_ the theory is
can n't argue with
do the same _EOS_
the volume of _eqn_
_SOS_ how did i
of the seiberg witten
of these __url__ _EOS_
type ii string theory
_SOS_ let us write
working on it _EOS_
an integration constant _EOS_
take my money _EOS_
gauge theory on the
the real question is
_SOS_ someone needs to
on the d brane
're not supposed to
restrict our attention to
_SOS_ notice also that
one of those things
for me it was
structure of the theory
_cite_ we obtain _EOS_
think it 's more
first term on the
like it would be
_eqn_ is an element
it 's my favorite
is to use the
keep that in mind
_SOS_ well he 's
the deformation of the
as discussed in the
i 'm not trying
do not need to
the fuck do you
_SOS_ is n't this
_eqn_ which implies _eqn_
and you 'll be
dependence of _eqn_ on
in the process of
to be equal to
it turns out to
reminded me of this
're going to have
the conservation of the
_SOS_ i was really
_SOS_ in _eqn_ the
that of _eqn_ _EOS_
well i 'm not
_SOS_ yup it 's
by a factor _eqn_
_SOS_ as it was
n't know but i
i want to do
which is consistent with
_SOS_ more precisely we
we 'll have to
_SOS_ the energy of
looks more like a
i have n't tried
to the cosmological constant
_SOS_ it 's for
_SOS_ we take _eqn_
a discussion of the
my first thought too
_SOS_ i just watched
_SOS_ the gauge field
_SOS_ you look like
on the one hand
_SOS_ sorry for the
is an integration constant
made me want to
of the string theory
_SOS_ thank god i
what follows we shall
in _cite_ where the
sure if serious _EOS_
i did n't really
next to leading order
the way to the
we recall that the
but it would be
will focus on the
the decomposition of the
you 'd like to
but it is a
it is worthwhile to
comments are in order
know why you 're
_SOS_ actually that 's
the string scale _EOS_
i 'd say the
of the action of
_SOS_ happy reddit birthday
the fundamental representation _EOS_
a pleasure to thank
used to it _EOS_
is expressed in terms
to have sex with
i think so _EOS_
while _eqn_ and _eqn_
defined as follows _EOS_
you 're right but
is what i thought
the fact that there
are related by the
did n't think about
_SOS_ as before we
_SOS_ they 're just
_SOS_ the equation _cite_
because i 'm a
i 'd go with
same way as in
_SOS_ well i have
be used in the
d _eqn_ brane _EOS_
how did you find
does n't matter _EOS_
theory in terms of
section _cite_ we discuss
who do you think
_SOS_ ding ding ding
_SOS_ there exists a
i 'm assuming you
of the magnetic field
can be done in
even if it 's
_SOS_ _cite_ as _eqn_
it has nothing to
know it 's not
the results for the
_SOS_ at least i
's your point _EOS_
is encoded in the
of the gauge coupling
you know how to
i met your mother
to see this we
_SOS_ can you elaborate
can be defined as
the condition _eqn_ is
to figure it out
_SOS_ not to be
_SOS_ which is the
in the _eqn_ expansion
you think that 's
_SOS_ what part of
the zero mode of
it can be written
we have to go
i went to the
where _eqn_ represents the
in _cite_ see also
yes i am _EOS_
'd have to be
the density of states
_SOS_ we stress that
i 've always been
_SOS_ did you mean
two point function _EOS_
as good as the
the function _eqn_ in
and _eqn_ in eq
i 've been in
_SOS_ of course they
the space _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ each of the
to the rest of
_SOS_ phi _eqn_ _EOS_
not even close to
_SOS_ i was not
with the use of
as soon as you
in the choice of
_SOS_ true story _EOS_
in order to study
_SOS_ theta _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ well they are
but thank you for
is of the order
just do n't want
this work was done
_SOS_ the dynamics of
i used to do
point function of the
what does that have
'd be willing to
as in ref _EOS_
are expected to be
i saw it _EOS_
_SOS_ my bad _EOS_
if we set _eqn_
_SOS_ good luck with
is located at _eqn_
_SOS_ _cite_ is _eqn_
it is n't a
can n't figure out
field _eqn_ can be
_SOS_ as we mentioned
welcome to reddit _EOS_
_SOS_ not all of
the purpose of the
_SOS_ oh god the
the charge of the
action _cite_ is invariant
if i recall correctly
_eqn_ is the unit
on the ground _EOS_
_SOS_ we now discuss
it was n't for
an extension of the
_SOS_ do n't feel
the condition that _eqn_
_SOS_ yo dawg _EOS_
expression for _eqn_ is
that 's true but
that we have a
_SOS_ it is quite
done and done _EOS_
_SOS_ they have a
in this paper the
_SOS_ the solutions of
_SOS_ true but it
from this point of
the link to the
_SOS_ how old are
the metric _eqn_ is
which is related to
why i did n't
give a shit _EOS_
this gives rise to
i would if i
the operators _eqn_ are
case we have _eqn_
have a nice day
all i can think
the second and third
it might have been
of the zero modes
of the brane world
note that this is
that does n't sound
_eqn_ is the energy
do n't be silly
_SOS_ however one can
you know you can
n't want to know
work is supported by
_SOS_ i really wish
for any _eqn_ and
_SOS_ we argue that
does n't mean they
up to a constant
relations _cite_ and _cite_
the guy on the
i live in a
to the case where
_SOS_ looks more like
_SOS_ this is possible
functions on _eqn_ _EOS_
it it 's a
_SOS_ our aim is
this is probably the
_SOS_ that must be
our aim is to
in m theory _EOS_
probably one of the
the tensor product of
thought of when i
point out that the
they do n't like
_SOS_ from _cite_ it
nbsp amp nbsp amp
come to think of
this case _eqn_ and
_SOS_ the energy momentum
is the only one
equations _eqn_ where _eqn_
i 'm still waiting
are proportional to the
is the correct answer
_SOS_ i mean i
_SOS_ it corresponds to
_SOS_ well i 'll
the four dimensional theory
corresponds to _eqn_ and
_SOS_ now that i
definition of _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ holy shit you
if we want to
_SOS_ here is the
can also be written
_SOS_ we hope that
i was thinking it
i 'm all for
part of the _eqn_
_SOS_ glad to see
_eqn_ we need to
_SOS_ one has to
out of my mouth
_SOS_ thanks i 've
_SOS_ the _eqn_ term
_eqn_ so that we
i think you 'll
_eqn_ as shown in
my good sir _EOS_
_SOS_ yes and i
the latter can be
_cite_ can be solved
i was a little
'm not sure but
the effective action in
i 'll pm you
the case with _eqn_
_SOS_ suppose that _eqn_
will do thanks _EOS_
_SOS_ i swear i
to _cite_ and _cite_
at least it was
the inverse of _eqn_
_eqn_ acts on the
that does n't work
much smaller than the
well in that case
_SOS_ of course we
why you 're getting
part by the national
what i 've seen
guess i should have
let us start by
_SOS_ now we turn
the only way i
theory in four dimensions
there 's plenty of
and i love it
in section we give
that came to mind
to _eqn_ or _eqn_
_SOS_ i 'm all
_eqn_ defined by the
in five dimensions _EOS_
not if you 're
_eqn_ and _eqn_ vanish
and i can confirm
_eqn_ with _eqn_ as
that i think about
_SOS_ i actually like
theory compactified on _eqn_
_SOS_ we shall also
yeah it 's not
as you do n't
the absorption cross section
but it did n't
for the function _eqn_
_SOS_ and he 's
quantum field theories _EOS_
's not that bad
in _cite_ we obtain
expressions _cite_ and _cite_
to read it _EOS_
i could upvote you
when _eqn_ is a
in the second line
your dick in crazy
all of it _EOS_
in order to understand
i wonder if they
we notice that the
_eqn_ on the boundary
this is why you
_eqn_ for _eqn_ we
you want to get
thing i 've seen
we were able to
is there a way
the _eqn_ gauge symmetry
keep it up _EOS_
the question of the
of the matrix model
want to see it
came to say this
form of the _eqn_
_SOS_ do you live
a representation of _eqn_
i 'm just glad
the relationship between the
are related by a
i can only imagine
_SOS_ you want to
by _eqn_ where we
_SOS_ ok i 'll
can be constructed by
_SOS_ equation _cite_ is
would like to have
the lagrangian of the
to go back to
_SOS_ so you do
a quantum field theory
_SOS_ might as well
_SOS_ the question is
_SOS_ if he 's
can be decomposed into
mentioned in the introduction
you should n't have
_SOS_ because i 'm
corresponding to _eqn_ and
for a review see
people do n't know
scalar field in the
thanks for the clarification
between _eqn_ and the
does n't give a
's a pretty good
broken to _eqn_ _EOS_
expectation value of _eqn_
in the picture _EOS_
_SOS_ well he is
can be used for
_SOS_ maybe i 'm
the quantum theory _EOS_
it sounds like a
we will return to
_SOS_ i wish it
are given in appendix
_SOS_ i just read
at the fixed points
_SOS_ i thought of
string theory in the
_SOS_ if it makes
the dimension of _eqn_
_SOS_ if there is
straightforward to show that
the gauge field is
while you 're at
_SOS_ that 's fine
be viewed as the
if you 're on
order by order in
_SOS_ i thought we
_eqn_ is an integration
_SOS_ lol it 's
_eqn_ and consider the
_SOS_ i was at
the map _eqn_ is
_SOS_ consider for example
_SOS_ the problem with
keep an eye out
we can find the
_SOS_ i guess we
to _eqn_ _cite_ _EOS_
it 's amazing how
the form _eqn_ which
_SOS_ in the rest
the link __url__ _EOS_
by the equation _eqn_
it at all _EOS_
_SOS_ there are some
it 's from a
's been a while
reduces to _eqn_ _EOS_
in the spectrum of
would n't be a
of _eqn_ it is
you 'll be fine
of the type _cite_
you did n't even
it 's a bad
has to be a
the bosonic and fermionic
_SOS_ i feel bad
_SOS_ one can then
i 've seen the
is defined in _cite_
_SOS_ i hope he
where _eqn_ _eqn_ is
'll just have to
_SOS_ if we assume
_SOS_ source __url__ _EOS_
see in the next
that he did n't
the limit _eqn_ in
_SOS_ for any _eqn_
in one of the
_SOS_ i just realized
given in appendix _cite_
'm not trying to
the difference of the
i do n't wanna
in the second term
_SOS_ you should see
of _eqn_ as the
_SOS_ then we find
there will be a
_SOS_ we have studied
not that i 'm
found to be _eqn_
i would have been
independent of the choice
n't even have a
as explained in _cite_
for the link i
_SOS_ in the classical
i was wondering why
do n't see what
of the presence of
_SOS_ to do so
for the same reason
did n't say that
see e g _cite_
not as much as
the fluctuations of the
i still have n't
we shall assume that
_SOS_ _cite_ implies that
in the s _EOS_
defined as _eqn_ where
i 'll have a
_SOS_ haha thanks _EOS_
use the fact that
_eqn_ according to the
i get it now
a couple of days
the simplest case of
_eqn_ we recover the
by the way i
_SOS_ i 'm down
that it is the
_SOS_ we now show
it is a good
_SOS_ in general we
that 's what happens
section we show that
to the point where
the following properties _EOS_
would be a great
_SOS_ you should get
for _eqn_ in _cite_
are obtained from the
we are talking about
i came in here
we can rewrite the
_SOS_ we all know
this is the reason
the gauge fields _EOS_
you 're telling me
_SOS_ glad to hear
is an arbitrary function
_SOS_ substituting _cite_ into
you want to go
_eqn_ and _eqn_ but
why you 're being
he does n't want
of d branes _EOS_
_SOS_ i 'm using
where _eqn_ is any
_SOS_ no thanks i
are associated with the
they seem to be
to _eqn_ _eqn_ _EOS_
for it to be
may be considered as
_SOS_ well if it
following form _eqn_ where
_eqn_ is _eqn_ the
if he did n't
_SOS_ if _eqn_ we
think this is a
the vector _eqn_ _EOS_
would be nice _EOS_
and _eqn_ are respectively
that is a good
but i was n't
by _eqn_ which is
_SOS_ why would n't
can be treated as
think you need to
with that of the
for those of us
the application of the
_SOS_ i find that
is organised as follows
in particular in the
is the only way
coupling constant _eqn_ is
me too i 'm
going on here _EOS_
results of ref _EOS_
_SOS_ oh sorry i
the limit _eqn_ is
're going to be
to point out that
_cite_ is _eqn_ _EOS_
you are correct sir
_SOS_ i see it
_eqn_ and _eqn_ denotes
for small values of
i want to believe
_eqn_ and _eqn_ fields
i did n't do
do n't see a
one would like to
i think that would
the adjoint representation _EOS_
find that _eqn_ _EOS_
i just need to
_SOS_ in fact for
a big deal _EOS_
the gauge coupling constant
to make fun of
_SOS_ _cite_ we get
i could n't get
_eqn_ and _eqn_ has
get a lot of
_SOS_ up to now
and i have to
we will concentrate on
you are a gentleman
i 'm getting a
the equations for the
_SOS_ the behavior of
now i feel like
do n't you dare
present paper is to
the next to leading
why did n't i
_eqn_ this is a
really do n't know
if i was n't
it is not hard
because he 's a
is the set of
the following set of
feel your pain _EOS_
if we use the
_SOS_ whoa whoa whoa
in _cite_ and _eqn_
are taken into account
can n't remember the
according to _cite_ _EOS_
if you do it
best of luck _EOS_
boundary of _eqn_ _EOS_
in the direction of
it 's also a
matrix elements of the
you get an upvote
i do n't follow
if we choose _eqn_
it needs to be
the heat kernel coefficients
_SOS_ this was a
is in fact the
_SOS_ i love my
_cite_ as _eqn_ _EOS_
is the inverse of
you 're awesome _EOS_
in a _eqn_ dimensional
it was a pretty
but it is n't
of the form of
_SOS_ amen to that
as well as a
_SOS_ we now want
has to be the
_SOS_ yup __url__ _EOS_
the _eqn_ gauge field
that it 's the
we have _eqn_ _eqn_
n't say it was
the closed string sector
_SOS_ there should be
the gauge fixing term
it seems that the
out for you _EOS_
_SOS_ yeah i would
we will see below
an example of the
but i have to
_eqn_ satisfying _eqn_ _EOS_
a great idea _EOS_
and _eqn_ of _eqn_
thank you it 's
i love that movie
that _eqn_ i e
i think i was
is reduced to the
_SOS_ thank you kindly
the appearance of a
action can be written
what it was _EOS_
he looks like a
that the presence of
the theory on the
you very much i
in which _eqn_ _EOS_
n't get me wrong
_SOS_ i think his
we obtain _eqn_ and
all i know is
from the action _cite_
_SOS_ hey man i
for the description of
and it did n't
in the leading order
does n't have any
we have set _eqn_
_SOS_ i will never
_eqn_ and therefore the
_SOS_ it is in
know it 's a
how i feel about
in the remainder of
do n't get why
that _eqn_ and the
_SOS_ and you can
of the present work
thought of as the
you did n't _EOS_
and what is this
of the results of
in the matrix model
than you think _EOS_
_SOS_ what if it
for valuable discussions _EOS_
_eqn_ with _eqn_ is
be in my bunk
_SOS_ have n't seen
this suggests that the
_SOS_ i just bought
the integral over the
_SOS_ the metric of
it 's gonna be
's what i 've
the space of solutions
denote by _eqn_ _EOS_
do n't feed the
the core of the
there is no such
is no such thing
the _eqn_ s and
i can see the
in order to solve
_SOS_ we set _eqn_
_SOS_ you monster _EOS_
a good idea to
form _eqn_ on _eqn_
_SOS_ if you get
_SOS_ then one can
depend only on the
the love of god
the _eqn_ axis _EOS_
i 'll be the
in spite of the
is straightforward to check
that would be great
_SOS_ just the tip
integral in eq _EOS_
case in which the
you know what they
the space of the
this __url__ is what
i could give you
the physical interpretation of
in the notation of
to do the same
_SOS_ i am pretty
there is a unique
c c c combo
is that there is
all the same _EOS_
and _eqn_ will be
_SOS_ we can easily
i 've seen them
both of you _EOS_
in flat space _EOS_
's what happens when
to the action of
_SOS_ but you 're
order to find the
the connection between the
to see if it
'm pretty sure this
and _eqn_ in terms
am i missing something
can check that the
what is going on
in _cite_ for _eqn_
of the week _EOS_
_SOS_ the absence of
want to see the
_SOS_ for example it
_SOS_ too late _EOS_
it 's just an
the gauge transformation _eqn_
_eqn_ gauge symmetry _EOS_
glad to hear it
_SOS_ his name was
the interior of the
_SOS_ are you implying
_SOS_ they are given
i was just going
the simplest example of
_SOS_ no he was
which means that the
_SOS_ nope sorry _EOS_
we shall see in
a bunch of people
aim of this paper
a lot of them
is to show that
_SOS_ no you can
of the model is
_SOS_ i just wanted
of motion _cite_ _EOS_
do you know that
read off from the
arrive at the following
for me as well
_SOS_ really i thought
that _eqn_ so that
_SOS_ i wish you
value of _eqn_ in
this can be achieved
_cite_ in the limit
i 've always wondered
_SOS_ i do have
of _eqn_ corresponding to
_SOS_ the dimension of
too much of a
compactified on _eqn_ _EOS_
on a regular basis
_SOS_ hence _eqn_ is
_SOS_ i 'll let
and i 'll be
is in order _EOS_
_SOS_ i am sure
the kinetic term of
_eqn_ and hence the
there is a difference
can be seen that
i 'll do that
_eqn_ while _eqn_ is
upvotes for you _EOS_
_SOS_ i 'd prefer
_eqn_ by using the
's just me _EOS_
in our case _eqn_
_eqn_ up to a
you 're at it
_SOS_ furthermore it is
love that movie _EOS_
correct me if i
reason for this is
_SOS_ you could just
in order to compute
all makes sense now
is at _eqn_ _EOS_
it is related to
makes sense now _EOS_
a deformation of the
to the best of
are _eqn_ _eqn_ and
you 're not going
_eqn_ because of the
can be removed by
i do n't live
_SOS_ equations _cite_ and
function _eqn_ can be
that i 'm a
much larger than the
on the floor _EOS_
forms _eqn_ and _eqn_
this would be a
but i 'm going
one of them is
i was hoping to
the dimensions of the
we take _eqn_ and
i 'm one of
the boundary condition _cite_
a bound state of
what is this i
first order phase transition
to the internet _EOS_
out in _cite_ _EOS_
there are people who
in section _cite_ and
is the only thing
turn our attention to
as _eqn_ for _eqn_
my favorite part of
_SOS_ you could also
for different values of
_SOS_ who the hell
of motion in the
i think i am
linear in _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ however if we
it should n't be
_eqn_ can be interpreted
did n't know the
_SOS_ in contrast the
was going to ask
but this is not
think it might be
are the generators of
my guess is that
do a lot of
purpose of the present
_SOS_ the parameters _eqn_
pretty sure he 's
_SOS_ it is however
that 's part of
not much of a
tells us that the
i believe that 's
we believe that the
it is easily seen
what you 're looking
_SOS_ thanks i think
our starting point is
_SOS_ we call this
if you really want
_SOS_ yeah i got
the analysis of _cite_
_SOS_ the use of
but a lot of
is my favorite _EOS_
values of _eqn_ _eqn_
as much as you
from _cite_ we see
_SOS_ well i would
form _eqn_ and _eqn_
_SOS_ i hear you
in the string theory
_SOS_ some of these
does n't seem like
it were n't for
the action is invariant
_cite_ and _eqn_ _EOS_
i came to say
_SOS_ i read your
_eqn_ is assumed to
a good point _EOS_
given by _eqn_ for
_SOS_ it will n't
on _eqn_ _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ how does this
non bps d branes
that 's why the
the last two terms
_SOS_ no u _EOS_
of the type iia
discussed in detail in
going to go with
'm going to try
this equation can be
_SOS_ _cite_ this is
one of us _EOS_
_SOS_ dude that 's
is such that _eqn_
_eqn_ from _eqn_ to
do you know if
i had to go
transformation properties of the
better than expected _EOS_
non linear sigma model
in order to describe
that was a good
have ever seen _EOS_
work has been supported
on the inside _EOS_
there is no reason
_SOS_ but they 're
sign of _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ the metric on
it 's because i
_SOS_ as i said
of the branes _EOS_
the classical equations of
trying to make a
as discussed in section
pm me your email
_SOS_ lol i was
here we would like
_SOS_ the central charge
i think we can
_SOS_ i 'm saying
left and right moving
_SOS_ i do it
we only need to
_SOS_ he can n't
for _eqn_ which is
do n't care what
in each of the
the dependence of _eqn_
what that means _EOS_
gauge group _eqn_ and
oh i did n't
in the light of
just a little bit
at this point the
i think we should
're looking for _EOS_
_SOS_ thus _eqn_ and
_SOS_ sounds like the
the brane world scenario
does n't mean he
will be interesting to
_SOS_ oh dear god
as a matter of
_SOS_ i loved the
of the light cone
is true for the
like the idea of
i think we all
value of _eqn_ the
the correction to the
you 're just a
for _eqn_ we can
that it would be
_SOS_ he 's right
is said to be
're talking about the
choose _eqn_ and _eqn_
in the type iib
was meant to be
's what he said
to be independent of
's what i said
section we give a
linear combination of _eqn_
not the same thing
_SOS_ maybe you 're
_eqn_ and _eqn_ terms
i do n't find
_SOS_ and now you
invariant under the following
to the well known
where can i get
_SOS_ it 's possible
the background of the
_SOS_ the vanishing of
you 're right that
_SOS_ people do n't
the near horizon region
at one loop _EOS_
does n't mean i
_SOS_ very true _EOS_
in the simplest case
_SOS_ i am _EOS_
_eqn_ leads to _eqn_
_SOS_ _cite_ shows that
_SOS_ did you ever
i 'm sure we
of the heat kernel
i 'm referring to
it 's true i
of the three dimensional
_SOS_ you missed the
of the extra dimension
_SOS_ do n't have
be interesting to study
can n't say that
last term in _cite_
minimum of the potential
you can get it
_SOS_ that is correct
_cite_ it has been
n't wait for the
was discussed in _cite_
_SOS_ what happened to
_eqn_ with _eqn_ for
_SOS_ maybe it was
the partition function for
_SOS_ this situation is
hell out of me
_SOS_ i knew that
the first of these
_eqn_ such that _EOS_
if they did n't
've never been to
brief review of the
all over again _EOS_
we can conclude that
expression for _eqn_ _EOS_
let 's not forget
have an upboat _EOS_
will be presented in
_SOS_ because of this
and the rest of
_eqn_ dimensional space time
why can n't i
is a constant of
was wondering the same
i looked it up
not seem to be
_SOS_ so true _EOS_
the change of the
in the house _EOS_
we comment on the
_SOS_ love it _EOS_
_SOS_ this agrees with
more than once _EOS_
suppose that _eqn_ is
_SOS_ good thing i
is the dimension of
_SOS_ i refuse to
_eqn_ the first term
d branes in the
i get home _EOS_
_eqn_ and the second
i 've got to
not only that but
proportional to _eqn_ in
_eqn_ s are the
and a lot of
of a lot of
the gauge fields _eqn_
by _eqn_ for _eqn_
you have to go
_SOS_ cool i 'll
is straightforward to show
_SOS_ you may be
the corrections to the
_SOS_ as well as
symmetry of the theory
it will be interesting
need to be a
was the joke _EOS_
sense to me _EOS_
_SOS_ haha thanks i
in the _eqn_ _EOS_
glad to help _EOS_
this case there is
in the introduction _EOS_
why would you want
in our case we
what to do _EOS_
did you get that
the final result is
in the case that
we need to go
of the spectrum of
there 's no reason
_SOS_ ah i was
we work in the
convenient to introduce the
i could have sworn
are of order _eqn_
do what i can
the structure of _eqn_
the operator product expansion
up for it _EOS_
i think i need
limit of large _eqn_
_SOS_ let us show
_SOS_ this does n't
expansion of the universe
no it was n't
a picture of the
used in _cite_ _EOS_
_SOS_ the generators of
as it is _EOS_
be considered as the
i 'm glad it
_SOS_ as can be
i 'm having a
for instance in the
the same person _EOS_
can be taken to
it looks like he
_SOS_ but it was
of the phase space
_eqn_ for simplicity _EOS_
i 'm gonna have
_SOS_ i get that
in the decoupling limit
_SOS_ this research was
i do n't blame
_SOS_ it 's kind
is _eqn_ where we
_cite_ implies that the
came to my mind
_SOS_ i 'm doing
to deal with the
_SOS_ it seems to
on the branes _EOS_
i 'm interested in
thus _eqn_ and _eqn_
_SOS_ so you can
in section we study
given by _eqn_ _eqn_
sir are a gentleman
_SOS_ depends on how
_SOS_ the idea of
_eqn_ where _eqn_ in
you want to do
_SOS_ i too am
components of _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ she looks like
electric and magnetic fields
_SOS_ true that _EOS_
_eqn_ can be defined
_SOS_ because that 's
at low energies _EOS_
an even number of
that 's what my
can be described as
the best part is
sure it 's a
to the partition function
did n't realize it
the group _eqn_ is
i 'm waiting for
the d _eqn_ branes
the range _eqn_ _EOS_
we 've got a
_SOS_ i 've already
a crucial role in
_SOS_ thus we find
_SOS_ you need a
makes me feel like
takes the following form
i second that _EOS_
the boundary conditions are
in the course of
this is actually a
_SOS_ for _eqn_ _EOS_
do n't know you
_SOS_ yeah there 's
we refer to the
_SOS_ i totally agree
implies the existence of
_SOS_ for example consider
you do it _EOS_
_SOS_ i wish my
_SOS_ of course in
_SOS_ if i remember
_SOS_ the scalar field
it is reasonable to
that 's a little
there is a natural
you have n't been
if you can find
the commutation relations of
_SOS_ why is the
_eqn_ representation of _eqn_
's not really a
for the _eqn_ theory
i 'll tell you
us look at the
_SOS_ where is this
organized as follows in
spectrum of the theory
think there 's a
_eqn_ defined by _cite_
does it take to
an arbitrary function of
if you will _EOS_
the type iib theory
you might as well
_SOS_ yeah i agree
of the action _eqn_
_SOS_ this seems to
there is a lot
do n't mean to
to one of the
do n't worry _EOS_
for _eqn_ _eqn_ _eqn_
_SOS_ that is true
_cite_ is _eqn_ where
i am in the
that it does not
_SOS_ i also have
_eqn_ are defined in
n't do that _EOS_
the theory in the
_SOS_ this solution is
be at the top
_SOS_ the action _eqn_
it 'll be a
is the field strength
you live in the
_SOS_ well that is
to the analysis of
for _eqn_ to be
you look at the
_SOS_ let us look
_SOS_ that 's okay
in more detail in
to post the same
_SOS_ well you can
smaller than _eqn_ _EOS_
for the _eqn_ model
kill it with fire
_SOS_ clever girl _EOS_
this is not true
few years ago _EOS_
of the energy density
_SOS_ delta _eqn_ _EOS_
the one in the
_eqn_ _cite_ _eqn_ _cite_
the guy with the
_SOS_ can n't say
_eqn_ and _eqn_ directions
_SOS_ i found this
_eqn_ given by the
_SOS_ unless you are
form _cite_ ds _EOS_
is a non trivial
what i do _EOS_
_SOS_ and it was
this work was partially
's the one _EOS_
conditions _cite_ and _cite_
i 'd be more
only if _eqn_ is
is a bit of
is contained in the
_SOS_ or you can
in the landau gauge
_SOS_ wow i did
the one loop correction
i think i may
in fact this is
_SOS_ i 'll allow
an odd number of
_SOS_ are you going
_SOS_ to get the
and _eqn_ on _eqn_
that is awesome _EOS_
and it 's still
that the action of
never be the same
which is the same
n't think this is
the image of _eqn_
_eqn_ have to be
i was kind of
field strength _eqn_ is
long as you 're
_eqn_ where _eqn_ has
that 's the spirit
chern simons gauge theory
i 'm done with
_cite_ as _eqn_ where
in the states _EOS_
that 's about it
the continuum limit _EOS_
_SOS_ something tells me
_cite_ can be used
at the tree level
way to do it
_SOS_ they 're both
in _cite_ is the
'm not really sure
a particular case of
_eqn_ and _eqn_ into
he would n't have
no you 're not
the asymptotic form of
of the properties of
with that one _EOS_
are related by _eqn_
is what it is
_SOS_ the properties of
the back of my
're an idiot _EOS_
_ix_ and _ix_ are
vacuum expectation values of
way to find out
quite a bit _EOS_
this means that in
_SOS_ you are my
_eqn_ as can be
in analogy with the
so i would n't
we point out that
you really do n't
in the bosonic case
this guy is a
it is found that
it was the only
like to think that
we begin with a
_SOS_ you 'll have
is a special case
_SOS_ yeah if you
is fixed by the
_SOS_ how 'd you
_eqn_ can be calculated
_eqn_ with _eqn_ we
the hell are you
_SOS_ also note that
are we talking about
is clear from the
people on the internet
i 'm glad that
of the algebra of
_SOS_ the ground state
to be fair he
end of the world
to be consistent with
_SOS_ that one is
theory with gauge group
_SOS_ to calculate the
they do n't even
we can define a
you want it to
indeed the case _EOS_
what you are talking
_SOS_ would it be
_eqn_ one obtains the
also note that the
the first time in
_SOS_ yeah they 're
which we denote by
_eqn_ for _eqn_ the
it because it 's
come at me bro
to the equation of
n't think he 's
the black hole entropy
follows that _eqn_ is
it 's a reference
's a reference to
part by nsf grant
functions _eqn_ _eqn_ and
least it 's not
not be able to
see that _eqn_ _EOS_
in section iii we
that makes more sense
_SOS_ at least the
the _eqn_ space _EOS_
i 've never even
now we turn to
_eqn_ where _eqn_ represents
that thanks for the
a way that _eqn_
there 's no such
be independent of the
you need to get
_SOS_ judging by the
of eleven dimensional supergravity
_SOS_ i go to
for future work _EOS_
_eqn_ which leads to
you were going to
_SOS_ are n't you
_SOS_ to compute the
are expressed in terms
we were talking about
have anything to do
to the leading order
_SOS_ i work in
expectation values of the
_SOS_ yes yes yes
have used the fact
and _eqn_ we can
what i want to
asymptotic behaviour of the
beg to differ _EOS_
it it 's not
superfields _eqn_ and _eqn_
's a bit of
_eqn_ and _eqn_ may
_SOS_ then it 's
on the brane and
_SOS_ i was under
of degree _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ i disagree i
the calculation of _eqn_
_SOS_ if they 're
is an arbitrary constant
i 'm thinking about
of _eqn_ by the
_eqn_ is a scalar
what the hell _EOS_
of the time it
_SOS_ both _eqn_ and
have n't seen this
all i could think
be invariant under the
are you from _EOS_
in order to calculate
on the bright side
we need to consider
is a subgroup of
thank you for sharing
he 's referring to
that _eqn_ which is
is the mass of
nom nom nom _EOS_
but it 's just
for example for _eqn_
_SOS_ maybe if you
the form _eqn_ in
pretty sure this is
type iib on _eqn_
needs to be a
the leading order in
_SOS_ hence we can
_SOS_ that could be
_SOS_ it is indeed
is possible to construct
_SOS_ only if they
the representation _eqn_ _EOS_
i was hoping it
see that this is
it 's actually the
obtained from _eqn_ by
can n't see it
is to find the
_SOS_ sounds like it
field is given by
_SOS_ redditor for months
_SOS_ the dependence of
_SOS_ they need to
_eqn_ are arbitrary constants
a couple of years
let us take the
it 's not in
to one correspondence between
_SOS_ i 'd go
the euler lagrange equations
_SOS_ good call _EOS_
where we used the
and _eqn_ is defined
i had to do
_SOS_ one finds that
i was thinking i
_eqn_ and _eqn_ while
let you know _EOS_
_SOS_ this equation is
do with anything _EOS_
'm more of a
be given by the
from what i understand
in the pp wave
in the _eqn_ of
you son of a
just do n't understand
_SOS_ yeah i had
general solution of the
on a daily basis
the second class constraints
if _eqn_ is not
quite a bit of
_SOS_ what can i
_eqn_ and _eqn_ only
i know exactly what
to the choice of
gauge field _eqn_ is
it 's great _EOS_
_SOS_ oh i do
plan of the paper
do n't have it
the brane at _eqn_
_SOS_ let _eqn_ _EOS_
if only i had
i can vouch for
directly related to the
end of the day
combination of _eqn_ and
unless you 're a
_SOS_ that 's more
_eqn_ is the only
quantum field theory is
they 're trying to
got a lot of
in _cite_ _eqn_ is
_SOS_ well said _EOS_
recall that _eqn_ is
never heard of them
order in perturbation theory
n't think i could
see that _eqn_ and
rest of us _EOS_
the case _eqn_ _eqn_
we remark that the
you talking about the
_eqn_ if and only
the good work _EOS_
_SOS_ it is evident
i did n't read
end of this section
i was wondering the
in the spectrum _EOS_
it 's not funny
something along the lines
the self duality condition
_SOS_ i call it
_eqn_ leads to a
i wish there was
on the _eqn_ _EOS_
n't know about you
the weak coupling limit
_eqn_ with _eqn_ given
because i 'm not
as a first step
i have n't read
section we will discuss
would be the best
_SOS_ i made a
be given by _eqn_
the functions _eqn_ _eqn_
well that 's a
but that 's what
given in eqs _EOS_
_SOS_ haha thank you
structure of the _eqn_
_SOS_ i came in
value of _eqn_ and
is what happens when
the variable _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ we can n't
a better understanding of
came here looking for
we will show in
_SOS_ yes i think
this section we briefly
this section we review
you would have to
from _ix_ and _ix_
i 'm fairly certain
do n't think she
for arbitrary _eqn_ _EOS_
show that _eqn_ _EOS_
to find it _EOS_
_SOS_ now i have
_eqn_ defined in eq
_eqn_ and _eqn_ commute
i know i 've
by _eqn_ _eqn_ _eqn_
not sure why i
in a couple of
we will consider a
done in _cite_ _EOS_
what i thought too
a huge fan of
in the second case
_SOS_ since there is
welcome to the internet
forward to it _EOS_
the generator of the
as well as for
do n't like _EOS_
for _eqn_ _eqn_ is
in the comments _EOS_
in the near future
this agrees with the
_SOS_ he is the
are functions of _eqn_
the _eqn_ _eqn_ _eqn_
with you on that
's because it 's
terms of _eqn_ _eqn_
_SOS_ starting from the
at least he 's
_eqn_ _eqn_ being the
a good time _EOS_
the formula for the
try this __url__ _EOS_
be understood as a
was n't aware of
_SOS_ i did and
obtained in ref _EOS_
how do you like
with the case of
_SOS_ i 'm having
the same number of
_SOS_ actually it is
is that _eqn_ is
never even heard of
to be invariant under
in some detail _EOS_
would be a better
and we have _eqn_
like to have a
compactified on a circle
i assumed it was
in order to define
least that 's what
i actually do n't
the choice of a
can be represented in
did you go to
have one of those
is that in the
not sure but i
of the parameters _eqn_
i 'd hate to
with _eqn_ for _eqn_
consider the case when
i just could n't
_SOS_ michael scott _EOS_
_SOS_ the condition _eqn_
_SOS_ i know how
reason is that the
n't you have a
the points _eqn_ and
's not even a
described by the action
'm not sure about
_SOS_ due to this
_SOS_ if we now
i 'm just trying
let us suppose that
that 's a shame
field theory in the
that 's good to
o o o o
the d brane _EOS_
n't worry it 's
respect to _eqn_ we
he was referring to
the sake of simplicity
i could n't even
is given in appendix
_SOS_ i would if
_SOS_ let us examine
_SOS_ well yeah but
in connection with the
a while ago _EOS_
it is not necessary
's not what i
the magnitude of the
never be able to
the negative tension brane
_eqn_ that is the
you i do n't
_SOS_ it 's even
_eqn_ one finds _eqn_
_SOS_ i watched it
the free energy of
maybe it 's a
this is a consequence
_eqn_ in the action
then i do n't
_eqn_ by _eqn_ in
i want to get
_eqn_ and _eqn_ depend
a year ago _EOS_
_SOS_ are you in
is well known _cite_
thats what i was
we can construct the
_SOS_ at least we
and _cite_ we have
does n't matter if
we consider only the
_SOS_ but i do
and _eqn_ _eqn_ _eqn_
constant and _eqn_ is
how did you do
_SOS_ this model is
do n't want a
_SOS_ using the above
not sure if this
_SOS_ _cite_ i e
and this is why
is defined to be
what the fuck did
no i have n't
of this equation is
_SOS_ just because you
the leading term in
i know a guy
the fields _eqn_ _EOS_
do n't call me
the zero point energy
it was a great
rather than _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ did anyone else
_eqn_ with the same
in the fact that
yeah i can n't
_SOS_ to make the
or this __url__ _EOS_
_SOS_ yeah that is
thus we conclude that
by the time i
we get _eqn_ and
but there 's a
form of _eqn_ is
_cite_ is devoted to
so i had to
n't know much about
of _eqn_ does not
_SOS_ on the one
_SOS_ that may be
_SOS_ the _eqn_ dependence
_SOS_ you 're all
that 's just what
that due to the
fact that it 's
in the high temperature
_SOS_ you should check
this is in agreement
_SOS_ the algebra of
best kind of correct
_SOS_ _cite_ _eqn_ and
am i doing it
the factor _eqn_ is
thing happened to me
this result can be
was n't going to
_SOS_ may i ask
the previous subsection _EOS_
_SOS_ i do too
of one of the
_SOS_ i 've made
it has been argued
i knew i was
it was argued that
_SOS_ for example one
_SOS_ really that 's
's all good _EOS_
_eqn_ can be regarded
'd be able to
to be given by
he was going to
parametrized by _eqn_ _EOS_
right now i 'm
time evolution of the
and it was a
is in fact a
_SOS_ for the lazy
is the presence of
into _cite_ we obtain
not all of us
_SOS_ have n't you
is defined as follows
in the type iia
there 's nothing wrong
the sum over the
you would n't have
a day or two
the world sheet _EOS_
in the shower _EOS_
of the right hand
never heard of that
the terms proportional to
_SOS_ very much so
the resolution of the
_eqn_ can be determined
i know how to
's worth it _EOS_
work was partially supported
the hyper k hler
to look at the
as _eqn_ in the
does n't change the
_SOS_ not even close
the singularity at _eqn_
it right now _EOS_
the role of _eqn_
_SOS_ they are the
function of the _eqn_
need to know _EOS_
of the components of
if you were a
the space _eqn_ of
_eqn_ are determined by
's a trap _EOS_
_eqn_ in which case
straightforward to check that
this is what happens
never said it was
to check that _eqn_
_SOS_ we conclude with
it to me _EOS_
that there 's a
the _eqn_ theory is
of _cite_ in the
think of that _EOS_
_SOS_ i must have
finally in section we
know if it 's
of _eqn_ _eqn_ is
_SOS_ wait are you
in the interior of
_SOS_ the five dimensional
think that would be
on the number of
would have been better
_SOS_ thus _eqn_ _EOS_
but this is the
_SOS_ thank you thank
_eqn_ we get _EOS_
is the one that
obtained from eq _EOS_
kind of thing _EOS_
the fields _eqn_ are
i do n't go
to prove that the
it was the best
of the poincar group
_SOS_ it 's better
expression for _eqn_ in
and _eqn_ should be
not the same _EOS_
_SOS_ depending on the
i wonder if it
get over it _EOS_
_SOS_ you 're in
there are only two
'm a fan of
_eqn_ there are no
are the pauli matrices
why you got downvoted
be written as follows
do n't tell anyone
see that in the
what did you think
to show that this
yes it 's a
_SOS_ did you not
lie algebra of _eqn_
as was shown in
well it 's a
define _eqn_ and _eqn_
there has to be
_SOS_ god i love
the _eqn_ of the
_SOS_ i believe i
be described in terms
_SOS_ you have the
let us show that
's no such thing
of _eqn_ are given
_SOS_ yeah do n't
the _eqn_ brane _EOS_
of the scale factor
thing i have ever
can n't believe it
for _eqn_ in terms
_SOS_ i disagree with
the _eqn_ r symmetry
_eqn_ let _eqn_ be
that you have to
_SOS_ _cite_ gives _eqn_
let 's just say
_eqn_ for _eqn_ is
right next to the
is chosen to be
n't make sense _EOS_
_cite_ for a review
did you do that
in the representation _eqn_
i have n't even
the cohomology of _eqn_
just because it 's
the _eqn_ case we
_SOS_ _cite_ that _eqn_
it a shot _EOS_
_SOS_ yes there is
of the bound state
of the coordinates _eqn_
that you 're a
it would be like
we can compute the
for example _eqn_ _EOS_
for you good sir
_SOS_ for the record
implies that _eqn_ and
_SOS_ we also find
and here i thought
it 's not it
previous section we have
the size of a
we know that _eqn_
_SOS_ i 'm aware
of quantum gravity _EOS_
_eqn_ acting on _eqn_
my god it 's
for the lulz _EOS_
the potential _eqn_ is
it had to be
may be viewed as
can be solved by
you 're absolutely right
_SOS_ only if it
be proportional to _eqn_
_SOS_ the field strength
i can see how
_SOS_ i always wondered
but it is not
and you can n't
the same as those
_SOS_ i am an
and the number of
_eqn_ and _eqn_ represent
no it 's just
_SOS_ in all cases
it 's a nice
_cite_ are given by
i agree with the
taken to be _eqn_
think a lot of
depend on the choice
here to say exactly
_SOS_ in section iv
_SOS_ nope chuck testa
_SOS_ i am sorry
_eqn_ does not vanish
and that 's how
we consider the following
at the fixed point
i 'm okay with
_SOS_ it is but
in powers of the
_SOS_ apart from the
_SOS_ this is amazing
_eqn_ given in eq
where i live _EOS_
notice that _eqn_ is
think it was the
_SOS_ as follows from
_SOS_ if you had
_SOS_ it is thus
_SOS_ works for me
be added to the
you 're wrong _EOS_
for the special case
going to say the
_SOS_ i made it
to _eqn_ _eqn_ and
sorry about that i
the space time _eqn_
_SOS_ so what 's
has been done in
a one parameter family
i really appreciate it
_SOS_ hell yeah _EOS_
of the renormalization group
_SOS_ amp amp __url__
in front of _eqn_
_SOS_ the sum of
do n't know much
me laugh so hard
show that this is
cosmological constant problem _EOS_
do n't know any
not difficult to see
you have to pay
i could upvote this
the solution of eq
both sides of the
yes thank you _EOS_
the correspondence between the
the first one i
's what i get
_eqn_ here we have
but we do n't
the organization of this
_SOS_ __url__ this is
the radial coordinate _eqn_
_SOS_ we will refer
_SOS_ what am i
have _eqn_ with _eqn_
i 'll try that
was a lot of
considered in this paper
where this is going
a hole in the
loop corrections to the
n't know what it
the ground state _EOS_
for reminding me of
in part by doe
_cite_ we discuss the
that 's what makes
_eqn_ is the curvature
a waste of time
's not a bad
the one of the
can be determined by
never had a problem
and _eqn_ we get
in the video _EOS_
_SOS_ says the guy
a matter of fact
_SOS_ sorry i meant
do you know _EOS_
string theory compactified on
considered in ref _EOS_
it 's easier to
maybe that 's why
to make contact with
_SOS_ can n't you
_SOS_ the basic idea
my point was that
organised as follows _EOS_
's the one i
such that _eqn_ for
he does n't know
the _eqn_ twisted sector
_cite_ we get the
i wish i did
_cite_ and in the
n't worry i 'm
i hope you do
shows that _eqn_ is
as you can see
large _eqn_ limit the
do n't worry they
of the equation _eqn_
gauge transformations of the
there are lots of
i 'd be willing
not invariant under the
_SOS_ oh my bad
is the space of
boundary conditions in the
i 'd say _EOS_
_SOS_ thanks for posting
_eqn_ subgroup of _eqn_
_SOS_ then _eqn_ _EOS_
i 'll try and
in a number of
probably never heard of
the lazy __url__ _EOS_
to the non abelian
_eqn_ we obtain a
n't get the reference
thought this was a
with _eqn_ or _eqn_
_SOS_ in _eqn_ dimensions
_SOS_ let 's see
_SOS_ by the way
to the brane _EOS_
_SOS_ to simplify the
you just blew my
do n't have one
this will be the
'm so glad i
_eqn_ is finite _EOS_
_SOS_ ah yes i
will be given by
now i get it
the term _eqn_ _EOS_
yang mills theory is
yes i did _EOS_
i just had to
in the region of
a positive cosmological constant
really appreciate it _EOS_
is pretty much the
of _eqn_ s _EOS_
that makes me feel
the complex structure of
_eqn_ are the pauli
i can n't read
power of _eqn_ _EOS_
to let you know
_eqn_ and using the
i am trying to
if you want it
to each other by
_SOS_ we conclude this
feel like i 've
_SOS_ i might be
formulated in terms of
i can tell by
one can verify that
_SOS_ thank you you
the parameter _eqn_ in
has the form of
me every time _EOS_
good luck to you
of the d _eqn_
has _eqn_ and _eqn_
i 'm here for
_SOS_ as we see
_SOS_ let 's hope
can n't go wrong
this is in fact
in appendix _cite_ we
i 'm gonna be
proposed in ref _EOS_
representations of the _eqn_
you think you 're
_SOS_ let us choose
_SOS_ yo dawg i
_SOS_ but do n't
_SOS_ in a recent
_SOS_ the geometry of
make any sense _EOS_
'll have to try
invariant under the gauge
is why i 'm
the one loop _eqn_
_eqn_ is to be
you have to ask
one can obtain the
you liked it _EOS_
taking the time to
which is independent of
_SOS_ for more details
had no idea _EOS_
note that it is
oh god i 'm
it has n't been
_SOS_ this kind of
did n't even have
_SOS_ i hate the
the investigation of the
_SOS_ the authors are
you can do that
_cite_ which can be
to go to a
_eqn_ and _eqn_ a
n't know it was
are two types of
i feel like the
does not have any
you 're in a
is n't that bad
the only non vanishing
_SOS_ __url__ it 's
the coordinates _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ i may have
of the orbifold group
_SOS_ the first order
the crap out of
components of _eqn_ are
they do n't need
_SOS_ i would never
be rewritten as _EOS_
_SOS_ the covariant derivative
to be in a
if you read the
let _eqn_ _eqn_ be
_SOS_ one of us
you think i 'm
_SOS_ i must be
the energy density _eqn_
_SOS_ the equation for
to be the best
_SOS_ you mean a
the fixed points of
_SOS_ no no you
this is in contrast
_SOS_ i just finished
transformation _eqn_ where _eqn_
as it is well
being a dick _EOS_
the large _eqn_ expansion
way you think _EOS_
_eqn_ is the scalar
i 've yet to
_SOS_ sounds good _EOS_
in agreement with _cite_
_eqn_ is called a
do n't ask me
because that 's what
we choose _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ _cite_ the _eqn_
that would be pretty
_SOS_ we write _eqn_
do n't like to
and _eqn_ it is
that for you _EOS_
'm just trying to
_SOS_ we choose _eqn_
other hand it is
see what happens _EOS_
_eqn_ to _eqn_ is
i see your point
_SOS_ to construct the
it 's a really
a long time to
the gauge fixing condition
just the tip _EOS_
the type i theory
going to happen _EOS_
the action _eqn_ _EOS_
determined in terms of
did n't know _EOS_
_SOS_ the integration over
one of the funniest
_eqn_ depending on the
see what you mean
_SOS_ i actually have
groups _eqn_ and _eqn_
in ten dimensions _EOS_
me all the time
do you know the
operator _eqn_ can be
_SOS_ you have my
is interpreted as the
_SOS_ kind of like
this is to be
the best part _EOS_
yang mills theory on
_SOS_ it was pretty
has been given in
and _eqn_ if _eqn_
do you really think
can n't upvote this
let us examine the
_SOS_ no one is
the pauli matrices _EOS_
_SOS_ _cite_ reduces to
love you too _EOS_
_eqn_ is the euler
on the left _EOS_
but how do you
on the space time
_SOS_ here __url__ you
by a set of
for the day _EOS_
higher order terms in
_SOS_ in particular a
you have a point
_SOS_ there 's only
larger than _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ and you are
spaces _eqn_ and _eqn_
i remember correctly _EOS_
the irreducible representations of
_SOS_ we thus have
have n't seen a
_SOS_ i hear that
that if _eqn_ then
it 's full of
of _eqn_ we obtain
_SOS_ who do you
_cite_ we consider the
the same amount of
will see in the
for _eqn_ one has
for a few months
_SOS_ we shall not
you can n't really
_SOS_ i believe so
the representation of _eqn_
would you want to
depends on _eqn_ and
for a couple of
_SOS_ oh well i
_eqn_ when _eqn_ is
bundle _eqn_ over _eqn_
i feel sorry for
_eqn_ in the large
like it 's a
_SOS_ the solution for
i 'm going with
_SOS_ that guy is
derived in _cite_ _EOS_
as in _cite_ and
it 's a real
can n't see the
the sum of all
_SOS_ son of a
on the boundary _eqn_
some people do n't
the finiteness of the
of the dilaton field
the fuck is this
can write _eqn_ where
sorry for the confusion
a lot better than
now we want to
i just had a
reflects the fact that
_eqn_ n _eqn_ _EOS_
did you get the
_SOS_ my pleasure _EOS_
eigenvalues of _eqn_ are
_SOS_ i have heard
the background of a
's not the same
in the former case
if you think that
the vacuum expectation values
answer to this question
not even close _EOS_
are the following _EOS_
just let me know
_eqn_ which are the
no you can n't
me about it _EOS_
with the metric _eqn_
could n't think of
second order in _eqn_
powers of _eqn_ and
used to live in
_SOS_ thus we conclude
i probably should have
_SOS_ as pointed out
in a good way
__url__ i do n't
rest of this paper
even if it was
we have to take
_SOS_ if _eqn_ _eqn_
looks like i 'm
of space time _EOS_
that 's all you
i know this is
the general structure of
of the gauge fixing
to worry about _EOS_
_SOS_ i work at
_eqn_ on the right
a whole bunch of
representation of _eqn_ and
_SOS_ of course he
see that the _eqn_
_eqn_ in the same
well it 's not
i 'd be interested
the four dimensional planck
_eqn_ is non zero
late to the party
_eqn_ and of the
really want to know
be on to something
the gauge hierarchy problem
that was n't a
the aim of the
the order _eqn_ _EOS_
you did n't see
_SOS_ i am now
to the discussion of
it 's such a
it can be checked
_SOS_ in the former
should be fine _EOS_
_SOS_ the commutation relations
look at it _EOS_
the other one _EOS_
the representations of the
for a few days
shown in _cite_ the
of _eqn_ into _eqn_
to be that guy
_SOS_ no __url__ _EOS_
is gauge invariant _EOS_
on the left hand
will never be the
difficult to see that
just out of curiosity
i 'm looking forward
the metric _cite_ _EOS_
's nothing wrong with
the effective potential _EOS_
i 've heard this
the limit _eqn_ _eqn_
_SOS_ you mean this
the case that the
_SOS_ i hear ya
we do not consider
is a pretty good
us return to the
_SOS_ are n't they
appearing in eq _EOS_
_SOS_ i hope not
is a linear combination
_SOS_ did you even
we can choose _eqn_
at _eqn_ _eqn_ _EOS_
i think we have
section we describe the
take your word for
_SOS_ i was on
_SOS_ in the simplest
_SOS_ as a matter
from what i can
the right hand sides
you could say that
_SOS_ i 'm no
section we present the
_SOS_ i 'd take
the form ds _EOS_
it 's like they
the equivalence of the
for example if _eqn_
i 've done this
i was just being
of _eqn_ given by
have to say that
the form _cite_ with
glad you enjoyed it
vector field _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ this could be
the special case _eqn_
does n't even have
is dominated by the
_eqn_ and _eqn_ branes
n't we all _EOS_
_SOS_ as usual the
it 's too bad
_SOS_ the right hand
looks a lot like
are given in terms
have to check it
a member of the
with _eqn_ _eqn_ _eqn_
's a great idea
the example of the
in your mouth _EOS_
the effective potential _eqn_
on _eqn_ with the
totally worth it _EOS_
can get away with
the algebra of functions
relations _eqn_ and _eqn_
sorry i can n't
i 'd rather be
relation _eqn_ where _eqn_
of _eqn_ for which
wish i could give
_SOS_ no you did
_cite_ together with the
convenient to use the
i wonder if he
identified with _eqn_ _EOS_
it 's time for
does n't count _EOS_
we see that we
i know that feel
is convenient to define
and thought it was
the kernel of the
i 'd say you
is the well known
and _cite_ we can
to be funny _EOS_
the transformation properties of
yeah that 's why
anything wrong with that
assume that _eqn_ and
_SOS_ sounds good to
of the vector _eqn_
found in _cite_ and
n't think you know
_SOS_ what 's with
we arrive at _eqn_
_SOS_ here we would
_SOS_ thanks for pointing
_SOS_ in case you
we now show that
_SOS_ the generalization of
i 've been thinking
_SOS_ so are you
_eqn_ satisfies _eqn_ _EOS_
going to make a
the cosmological constant _eqn_
_SOS_ i understand that
for our purposes _EOS_
because you can n't
the case of non
_SOS_ the result for
too i do n't
just do n't like
to do so we
_SOS_ based on the
looking forward to the
do n't forget that
the _eqn_ function _EOS_
of the torus _EOS_
some of them are
_SOS_ and _eqn_ _EOS_
brought to you by
it was n't the
the form _cite_ _eqn_
__url__ it 's a
be replaced by _eqn_
_SOS_ even if you
in terms of this
know i was just
limit of _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ i 'll go
and _cite_ we get
in my bunk _EOS_
there are two types
_SOS_ the eigenvalues of
i 'm afraid _EOS_
in a few days
of order _eqn_ in
_SOS_ the field theory
just make sure you
_SOS_ throughout this paper
not trying to be
i hope you have
in the t dual
in the five dimensional
you 've never seen
_eqn_ and we can
it seems like a
_SOS_ same for me
it is invariant under
how the hell did
that _eqn_ in the
_SOS_ _cite_ in terms
a lot of good
_SOS_ if there are
look into it _EOS_
n't know how i
the pp wave background
hope you 're not
paper is organised as
_SOS_ you are very
is described by _eqn_
_SOS_ well i 've
one of the authors
most of them are
we will see later
_SOS_ i do i
part by the u
_SOS_ prove it _EOS_
_eqn_ with the _eqn_
of the people who
that the partition function
i want you to
section we would like
have a link to
the k hler form
of the theory of
such a thing _EOS_
i bet you 're
it is hard to
a similar way _EOS_
wait a minute _EOS_
_SOS_ i 've just
we see that for
here __url__ you go
the background field method
if i were you
the literature _cite_ _EOS_
and _eqn_ we find
i 'm an atheist
the issue of the
thought when i saw
_SOS_ _cite_ is not
i forgot to mention
_SOS_ introduction introduction unnumbered
but thank you _EOS_
_SOS_ if you really
introduction introduction unnumbered _EOS_
_SOS_ _cite_ where _EOS_
_SOS_ i had that
i 'll see you
of _eqn_ so that
_eqn_ of the gauge
you got me _EOS_
the _eqn_ case is
there 's no need
i 'm the one
to the _eqn_ and
that 's pretty cool
this is related to
at the boundary of
but now i 'm
_SOS_ you can be
we take the limit
case of a single
have a friend who
or you could just
the _eqn_ representation of
made me lol _EOS_
our goal is to
go back to the
which implies that _eqn_
_SOS_ for definiteness we
do n't have enough
_SOS_ we will then
let me know what
shown in table _cite_
_SOS_ maybe i should
field _eqn_ is a
it 's shit like
leading order in the
_SOS_ i ai n't
effective action in the
_SOS_ what does this
which corresponds to _eqn_
developed in _cite_ _EOS_
there a way to
_SOS_ did n't even
_SOS_ this makes the
right there with you
the string field theory
_eqn_ and _eqn_ become
is the name of
not at all i
_SOS_ we also show
think you might be
have n't seen any
with _cite_ and _cite_
_SOS_ in this gauge
to a lot of
that the existence of
want to watch the
_SOS_ then in the
that 's a really
have to wait until
of the most important
it is tempting to
of your jib _EOS_
_SOS_ is it bad
invariance of the theory
_SOS_ all of these
you for reminding me
_SOS_ first note that
for the last years
_eqn_ on the brane
it or not _EOS_
gauge theory _cite_ _EOS_
makes you feel better
_SOS_ it was on
in the model _EOS_
more like it _EOS_
so there is no
_eqn_ does not have
i would but i
or _eqn_ and _eqn_
to see that _EOS_
thank you for posting
at this stage we
it 's because they
_SOS_ the energy density
_SOS_ what did i
i just watch _EOS_
the effective potential for
is a picture of
let us recall that
_SOS_ now that you
which depends on the
in the fock space
trying to say _EOS_
kinetic term of the
oh i do n't
'll look into it
are now in a
i do n't trust
light cone gauge _EOS_
for more details _EOS_
what did he say
in fact we can
sorry i 'm not
the number _eqn_ of
this changes everything _EOS_
is your friend _EOS_
i figured it was
we take _eqn_ to
's pretty much the
now on we will
he did n't have
is of course the
is n't the same
of the variables _eqn_
_SOS_ i 'd imagine
be shown that _eqn_
are related to each
i think i saw
_SOS_ i heard the
case of _eqn_ and
the identity _eqn_ _EOS_
to go back and
_SOS_ if he was
irreducible representation of _eqn_
_SOS_ are you fucking
reading of the manuscript
_SOS_ i agree this
here _eqn_ is an
_SOS_ you can say
function _eqn_ in the
that you did n't
the inclusion of the
_SOS_ nah that 's
_eqn_ and _eqn_ both
back to you _EOS_
in _eqn_ we have
'm looking forward to
the latter case the
agreement with _cite_ _EOS_
looks like you 're
_SOS_ thus one can
just want to watch
_SOS_ i guess so
_SOS_ the large _eqn_
is this i do
sections _cite_ and _cite_
_SOS_ the derivation of
how do i get
that big of a
the ground state is
do you think they
of _eqn_ under the
try it out _EOS_
we need to know
as mentioned in the
me know when you
_SOS_ we assume the
_SOS_ well i did
the equations _cite_ and
you live in a
_SOS_ can n't be
we make use of
to be determined _EOS_
yes yes it does
_SOS_ let us make
they were going to
does n't really matter
it can also be
_SOS_ i have some
the boundary conditions _eqn_
_SOS_ by virtue of
_SOS_ you are so
but i 'm still
the case that _eqn_
_SOS_ this is to
the hell is this
_SOS_ oh god no
takes the form of
_SOS_ oh the irony
boundary conformal field theory
a direct consequence of
pointing that out _EOS_
i 'm too lazy
the _eqn_ expansion _EOS_
_SOS_ what 's it
quantum theory of gravity
_SOS_ haha i did
the operator _eqn_ in
_SOS_ yeah pretty much
in addition there are
now we are ready
to you too _EOS_
_SOS_ what in the
_eqn_ so _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ how do they
_cite_ has the following
in the above equation
's the only thing
this leads to _eqn_
of energy under grant
something like this _EOS_
_SOS_ and _cite_ _EOS_
_SOS_ is that really
the mass shell condition
want it to be
may be obtained by
the last time you
_SOS_ i do what
_eqn_ one finds that
but i 've seen
consistent with the fact
_SOS_ are you suggesting
irreducible representation of the
and you know it
for the calculation of
_SOS_ yeah and i
of the theory are
is easily seen that
when i was little
a lot more sense
be discussed in the
we obtain _eqn_ which
what you do n't
_SOS_ in appendix a
i guess i have
had n't thought of
with _eqn_ _cite_ _EOS_
i 'm sorry that
the string world sheet
that was awesome _EOS_
the mass of a
_SOS_ omega _eqn_ _EOS_
think you know what
i love me some
_SOS_ yeah i am
solution of _cite_ is
that does n't have
the transformations of the
_SOS_ i 'll never
_eqn_ and the gauge
_SOS_ _cite_e _eqn_ is
think that was the
glad to be of
in this case a
_SOS_ the lagrangian is
was one of those
_eqn_ is a polynomial
when i went to
_SOS_ thanks i appreciate
the vanishing of _eqn_
_SOS_ this theory has
i like how the
i got it _EOS_
to be zero _EOS_
_SOS_ yea i 'm
iib string theory _EOS_
of the generators of
you have to have
_eqn_ in the second
word with you _EOS_
_SOS_ i 'm interested
_SOS_ the expression _cite_
_SOS_ yea i was
the _eqn_ matrix _eqn_
_SOS_ is grateful to
the only person who
'm not alone _EOS_
two point function _eqn_
do n't use it
the solutions to the
_SOS_ this property is
waiting for someone to
i 've been meaning
the early universe _EOS_
've been meaning to
supported by the european
by the use of
of when i saw
us consider the _eqn_
will n't have to
i feel like that
in _cite_ we find
which implies that the
you are in the
_eqn_ is gauge invariant
you obviously do n't
i 'm tired of
in this direction _EOS_
have the right to
same as the one
not all of them
the classical moduli space
defined in _cite_ and
does n't bother me
want to see a
which corresponds to a
my wife and i
we can determine the
in the two dimensional
this time of year
and a half _EOS_
located at _eqn_ and
_eqn_ is shown in
is the shit _EOS_
i was just saying
the creation and annihilation
_SOS_ i have my
that _eqn_ as _eqn_
i i do n't
results of this paper
discussed in this paper
it 's not your
get away with it
the quantities _eqn_ and
at spatial infinity _EOS_
i 've ever been
the starting point is
to see if i
it 's super effective
the higher order terms
do you say that
rewritten as _eqn_ where
_SOS_ suppose that the
i do n't own
an analysis of the
i was just wondering
's the difference _EOS_
been given in _cite_
_SOS_ in addition it
_SOS_ thank you my
_SOS_ in doing so
i 've done it
do n't let the
the second one is
found it __url__ _EOS_
is no need to
_SOS_ why is n't
_eqn_ given by _EOS_
and i 'm pretty
this seems to be
i must have missed
in the transverse space
_SOS_ this is great
is the reason why
are based on the
when it came out
know how it goes
on _eqn_ is given
i was making a
so that we can
from _cite_ it follows
what i thought when
_SOS_ i am and
_SOS_ the _eqn_ function
_SOS_ the zero mode
wish i had more
me too but i
that the operators _eqn_
_SOS_ is that why
_eqn_ terms in the
it out __url__ _EOS_
was pointed out in
i 've never played
section we briefly review
second order in the
who does n't like
here we have used
it 's a big
i guess it was
the help of _cite_
_SOS_ upvoted for the
the correlation functions of
_SOS_ believe it or
and _eqn_ as the
_SOS_ dude i 'm
will be used in
_SOS_ why am i
_eqn_ and _eqn_ form
's got to be
_cite_ s d _EOS_
_SOS_ awesome i 'm
the adjoint of _eqn_
each of the two
it with fire _EOS_
do n't have much
in the non commutative
can n't believe that
case where _eqn_ is
if you are going
the coefficient _eqn_ is
be identified with _eqn_
he 's not the
one can consider the
thank you i will
in the following table
to say this but
it is in the
such that _eqn_ where
i feel like an
we will denote the
_SOS_ well you know
potentials _eqn_ and _eqn_
with period _eqn_ _EOS_
you 're interested in
_SOS_ this man is
_eqn_ tends to zero
the context of string
there 's anything wrong
's anything wrong with
it means that the
angular momentum of the
what happened to the
guess you could say
of the equation _cite_
in a way that
the scope of this
think i 've seen
we can construct a
may be regarded as
one upvote to give
_SOS_ no he is
_eqn_ we arrive at
_eqn_ bundle over _eqn_
works every time _EOS_
did n't have any
we show that this
_SOS_ i find this
the behaviour of _eqn_
i 've made a
see for instance _cite_
_SOS_ here _eqn_ _EOS_
each his own _EOS_
_SOS_ this term is
what a twist _EOS_
the central charge is
you just made my
_SOS_ nevertheless it is
_SOS_ why do they
to say it _EOS_
to thank m _EOS_
if you get a
solution of the equations
are you a wizard
thus we have _eqn_
_SOS_ as one can
_SOS_ i remember the
in this subreddit _EOS_
of the two _eqn_
if you think about
the amplitude of the
and _eqn_ where the
i must know _EOS_
and it can be
and this __url__ _EOS_
_SOS_ i find the
interesting to study the
thank you this is
that _eqn_ should be
i 'll get back
theory is described by
'll get back to
we will argue that
that it is n't
the only difference is
_SOS_ the second is
i want to play
_SOS_ however for _eqn_
_SOS_ that 's weird
i used to play
will depend on the
're the only one
rewritten as _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ let us suppose
could be wrong _EOS_
not sure if trolling
this is done by
i still have a
second class constraints _EOS_
going to have a
is taken into account
_eqn_ in the first
what it 's worth
_SOS_ this type of
your word for it
_SOS_ ahem __url__ _EOS_
de sitter space is
_SOS_ this is very
that we do n't
_SOS_ i 'm definitely
we use the notation
_SOS_ in each case
all the way through
_SOS_ are you trying
it is seen that
n't even know how
_SOS_ this condition is
_SOS_ this is all
_SOS_ wow this is
is not necessary to
_SOS_ then you should
that _eqn_ and that
_SOS_ the size of
is the kind of
old are you _EOS_
same form as the
_SOS_ there was no
related to the fact
_SOS_ you think that
does not mean that
with the boundary conditions
be written as the
that is n't a
_SOS_ the interpretation of
as long as we
_SOS_ as before the
how much of a
_SOS_ so if you
_SOS_ this problem is
gets me every time
this means that there
i would also like
the second line of
in the previous case
this is a very
model is given by
take that as a
_SOS_ let us summarize
when i read the
_SOS_ _cite_ to the
if you were n't
_SOS_ i agree and
in which case the
it follows from eq
need to go deeper
_SOS_ the outline of
they do n't get
for your loss _EOS_
let us define _eqn_
_SOS_ oh snap _EOS_
now in a position
be interesting to understand
shut your whore mouth
_eqn_ the set of
lots and lots of
of the non commutative
that you 're not
loop correction to the
the point of this
i was expecting a
think of _eqn_ as
and _eqn_ are both
it 's more likely
n't even think about
of the calabi yau
it here __url__ _EOS_
this is similar to
to the action _cite_
what it looks like
_SOS_ we will first
trying to be a
at this point it
for pointing it out
be chosen to be
work for me _EOS_
_eqn_ can be decomposed
n't been able to
not a big deal
of motion _eqn_ _EOS_
of _eqn_ from the
over and over _EOS_
sounds like a great
the condition _cite_ is
happy to help _EOS_
this part of the
_SOS_ how 's that
in this section the
oh my god that
the four dimensional case
and this is the
of the ten dimensional
_SOS_ have you read
_eqn_ and there is
but i guess it
by the european commission
i thought of _EOS_
the type _eqn_ _EOS_
that came to my
under the transformation _eqn_
generators of _eqn_ _EOS_
if you 're looking
_SOS_ therefore we will
was hoping someone would
_SOS_ equations of motion
hope you have a
thanks for making me
we see that there
_SOS_ it was my
is a sum of
the randall sundrum model
is n't that a
potential is given by
it 's just like
the scalar field is
_SOS_ i sure hope
the main results of
_SOS_ why does it
the _eqn_ expansion of
_eqn_ is a vector
be the top comment
i guess i do
real part of the
_SOS_ one of these
going to post this
_SOS_ i do but
we find _eqn_ and
_SOS_ i never knew
the idea is to
i think it looks
the charges of the
do not want to
hilbert space of the
_SOS_ agreed it 's
invariant under the transformation
_SOS_ it 's worth
the notation _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ moreover we have
you really need to
_eqn_ and on the
c c combo breaker
_SOS_ i know and
the expectation values of
the _eqn_ dimensional space
to get it _EOS_
guess i 'm just
is to study the
the coupling to the
this is how you
symmetry is spontaneously broken
the only one to
be referred to as
just thought i 'd
i need to find
to the conclusion that
_SOS_ the effective potential
i knew it _EOS_
_eqn_ and _eqn_ gives
did n't know there
aid for scientific research
there needs to be
_SOS_ i actually do
as shown in figure
at the bottom _EOS_
of the gauge invariant
_SOS_ we calculate the
for the record i
because of this _EOS_
is much larger than
did n't get a
of the conformal field
check them out _EOS_
of the d3 brane
orders in perturbation theory
people do n't like
_eqn_ from eqs _EOS_
worked for me _EOS_
let us consider _eqn_
when you have a
_cite_ into _cite_ and
of your life _EOS_
lol i do n't
of length _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ that 's your
factors _eqn_ and _eqn_
of course it is
the reader to _cite_
_SOS_ he 's still
in order to simplify
_SOS_ it 's going
_eqn_ then we have
and i was like
not the case for
_cite_ and _cite_ as
you can n't use
_SOS_ in the usual
all of a sudden
is given in table
me know how it
i could n't tell
in _eqn_ i e
_SOS_ well done sir
kinetic term for the
_SOS_ the non abelian
_SOS_ you got a
_SOS_ i might have
theory in _eqn_ dimensions
how often do you
we note that in
_eqn_ must be a
it 's an awesome
_eqn_ is such that
both of them _EOS_
part of the problem
be equal to _eqn_
but i 'll be
by _cite_ _eqn_ where
get in the way
_SOS_ so what is
_cite_ is that the
i 've had it
if we assume that
the explicit expressions for
_SOS_ we will return
i can give you
do you happen to
do i need to
does n't know what
_SOS_ i could have
the one loop approximation
_SOS_ i lost it
of equations of motion
i 've seen on
one can easily check
kind of correct _EOS_
ourselves to the case
_SOS_ why would they
can be neglected _EOS_
_SOS_ awesome thanks for
in the randall sundrum
of _eqn_ to be
to be fair that
to do it for
we can take the
_SOS_ because it was
let us consider an
_eqn_ can be easily
n't think it would
in the last line
the correct answer _EOS_
i can n't afford
on the fact that
_eqn_ which does not
luck with that _EOS_
_SOS_ i 'm almost
we have chosen the
_SOS_ so this is
of this work is
_SOS_ this has the
have a point _EOS_
_SOS_ what i 'm
that _eqn_ has the
_SOS_ why do people
less than _eqn_ _EOS_
_eqn_ which has the
the benefit of the
can easily see that
have something to do
_SOS_ in two dimensions
soon as i saw
like a good idea
the function _eqn_ has
like the rest of
namely _eqn_ and _eqn_
_SOS_ do n't hate
_eqn_ acting on the
_eqn_ subgroup of the
it 's like you
it 's been years
we showed that the
in the real world
that for _eqn_ _eqn_
've been waiting for
because _eqn_ and _eqn_
if this is the
invariant under the action
it is shown in
the united states _EOS_
it 's for the
the analog of the
the front page of
will assume that the
we have _cite_ _EOS_
comes to mind _EOS_
equation of state _eqn_
_SOS_ i 'd hit
limit _eqn_ and _eqn_
_SOS_ i did a
in the derivation of
as in fig _EOS_
how does it work
all of us _EOS_
we will work in
all of the above
the moduli of the
_SOS_ not so much
in which _eqn_ and
terms of the new
that 's a nice
and if you do
green s function _eqn_
from each other _EOS_
i can do it
the definition of a
was the first time
a few days _EOS_
the extra dimension _EOS_
important point is that
tell by the pixels
_SOS_ i 'd do
schr dinger equation _EOS_
_SOS_ this might be
in appendix a we
do n't see anything
the abelian higgs model
back in my day
the results of ref
symmetry group of the
that would be amazing
does not exist _EOS_
you 're looking at
be expressed as a
the best i 've
in this paper are
now and then _EOS_
boundary conditions _cite_ _EOS_
he looks like he
for taking the time
in the next sections
action is _eqn_ where
here to post that
_SOS_ a friend of
e g _cite_ _EOS_
'll see if i
given by _cite_ with
_SOS_ we showed that
and i thought i
_SOS_ thus we may
a while back _EOS_
to the appearance of
_SOS_ sounds like he
and only if the
different values of the
well i guess i
_SOS_ yes but they
one correspondence with the
_eqn_ is the dimension
all the time in
_SOS_ so that the
i hope it 's
_SOS_ since there are
my first thought as
first thought as well
the ns ns sector
and _eqn_ must be
this is pretty much
_SOS_ for the first
my first thought _EOS_
a link to a
lead to the same
is the value of
you 've probably never
_eqn_ and _eqn_ transform
you were looking for
action in terms of
for some reason it
_SOS_ the first of
you read the article
_SOS_ i figured it
this can be easily
_eqn_ are the generators
n't thought of that
_cite_ is satisfied _EOS_
it to be a
_SOS_ we follow the
if there was a
'm sure you 'll
to the four dimensional
it is one of
that _eqn_ satisfies the
along the _eqn_ axis
how does that work
_SOS_ thus for _eqn_
it really does n't
_SOS_ therefore the _eqn_
_SOS_ yes but you
depend only on _eqn_
is the one i
boner right now _EOS_
to the boundary _EOS_
_eqn_ depend on the
but what about the
_SOS_ denote by _eqn_
i just got a
_SOS_ thanks for making
since _eqn_ is the
here i do n't
results of the previous
_SOS_ he 's an
operator _eqn_ in the
are characterized by the
i wanted to see
in any way _EOS_
summarized as follows _EOS_
_eqn_ where _eqn_ we
it was kind of
_SOS_ the best kind
to the black hole
_SOS_ i guess they
_eqn_ is a linear
i was there _EOS_
the result is a
_SOS_ maybe he was
the _eqn_ matrix _EOS_
at the time of
we will try to
_eqn_ and a _eqn_
one of the things
's the name of
due to the non
i was on my
sphere of radius _eqn_
by the condition _eqn_
that is the most
the index of the
there 's also a
because i did n't
to thank a _EOS_
is defined as _EOS_
only one way to
and here i was
the field _eqn_ in
in the _eqn_ gauge
was trying to be
_SOS_ lol i do
's all in the
yang mills theories _EOS_
_SOS_ _eqn_ can be
upvote this enough _EOS_
_SOS_ there 's one
national science foundation under
a direct sum of
out of context _EOS_
_SOS_ come on man
the viewpoint of the
for the time being
what have you done
_SOS_ from this point
you do n't really
but i like it
the exact form of
i 'm not entirely
terms in the effective
more to do with
this section we would
_SOS_ i 'm waiting
be obtained by the
sure it 's not
we have _eqn_ so
_SOS_ this is pretty
can be defined by
be obtained from _cite_
be the first to
_SOS_ depends on what
dimensional anti de sitter
_SOS_ now we want
the other side _EOS_
be generalized to the
check it out thanks
_SOS_ the model is
it 's amazing _EOS_
in particular for the
you 're missing out
_SOS_ i dont have
is equal to zero
_SOS_ my favorite part
_eqn_ in _cite_ are
i had to look
the metric _eqn_ and
_SOS_ with _eqn_ the
do n't get a
_SOS_ and then i
the general solution to
_SOS_ what if the
_cite_ where _eqn_ denotes
_SOS_ i did but
while _eqn_ is the
he does n't even
the effective action _cite_
at _eqn_ in the
i used to love
_SOS_ if we use
happened to me _EOS_
_SOS_ i use it
can easily check that
lt lt lt lt
that _eqn_ where the
_SOS_ to understand the
i 've always heard
and it was n't
when _eqn_ is large
it 's because of
this section we study
_SOS_ how many times
_SOS_ we work in
for _eqn_ eq _EOS_
on the side _EOS_
for simplicity we consider
you can n't tell
_SOS_ i guess he
_SOS_ one has _eqn_
_SOS_ hey you 're
which appear in the
_SOS_ if you know
that in the _eqn_
'll have to wait
the precise form of
may be used to
on my face _EOS_
i love reddit _EOS_
of the kaluza klein
_SOS_ does n't mean
is a well defined
are left with the
thanks for your help
be found in ref
for the clarification _EOS_
_SOS_ up vote for
the beginning of this
_SOS_ _cite_ using the
_SOS_ holy crap that
'll take it _EOS_
discussed in the next
had a chance to
the construction of _eqn_
_SOS_ does n't that
zero modes of _eqn_
_SOS_ the quantization of
love to see a
same thing happened to
the value _eqn_ _EOS_
and it 's the
_SOS_ i assume you
to carry out the
we have defined the
you mean like this
a seat over there
on _eqn_ with _eqn_
_eqn_ generated by _eqn_
the first person to
_SOS_ _eqn_ is an
like to know _EOS_
how long have you
of the solutions _EOS_
_SOS_ ah thanks _EOS_
we will not discuss
not sure how i
studied in ref _EOS_
_SOS_ sounds about right
grant in aid for
_SOS_ in some cases
i 'm fine with
had no idea that
with respect to this
_SOS_ we can define
_SOS_ yes sir _EOS_
_SOS_ this guy __url__
_eqn_ and _eqn_ cases
_SOS_ fuck that i
_cite_ we get _EOS_
_SOS_ fap fap fap
_SOS_ we have obtained
so it would be
this research was supported
benefit of the doubt
with _eqn_ i e
it 's pretty good
values of _eqn_ in
_SOS_ is that you
the last term is
_SOS_ some people just
_SOS_ the _eqn_ gauge
and you have to
in _eqn_ in the
_SOS_ yea it 's
that of the _eqn_
_SOS_ they 're the
like to thank a
_SOS_ in all fairness
up to an overall
's a bad thing
_SOS_ begin array c
_SOS_ to obtain a
it seems like it
i noticed that too
of this theory is
i 'd never heard
the point _eqn_ is
_SOS_ consider the following
_SOS_ okay __url__ _EOS_
how did i not
is replaced by a
_SOS_ in this regime
to look like a
_SOS_ i just started
section we derive the
_eqn_ it is clear
would be great _EOS_
gravity on the brane
had a problem with
_SOS_ end array _eqn_
throughout this paper we
what that is _EOS_
that makes sense i
the operators _eqn_ _EOS_
are you implying that
the fixed points _EOS_
a while now _EOS_
the states of the
_SOS_ take a look
solution for _eqn_ _EOS_
damn you beat me
for the fields _eqn_
_cite_ here _eqn_ is
the effective potential is
you were trying to
an irreducible representation of
in the long run
that is to say
took me a second
_SOS_ you can find
k hler potential _eqn_
in this limit we
is much better _EOS_
_SOS_ to describe the
nothing at all _EOS_
_SOS_ for instance _eqn_
_SOS_ i just hope
form field strength _eqn_
have to do it
_SOS_ these solutions are
it 's funny how
is it possible to
same as for the
all i can say
in the gauge _eqn_
solve the equations of
was the first one
given by the _eqn_
i heard you like
_SOS_ _cite_ leads to
_SOS_ chuck testa meme
chuck testa meme detected
the radius of _eqn_
and then there 's
dependence on _eqn_ _EOS_
the _eqn_ is the
where have you been
_SOS_ the other two
i dont want to
_SOS_ however since the
_SOS_ i need a
in section iv we
pm me if you
came here just to
first class constraints _EOS_
a better way to
of yang mills theory
_SOS_ by means of
it 's all the
_eqn_ is zero _EOS_
the fuck out _EOS_
did n't downvote you
the first chern class
_SOS_ the key point
who the fuck is
__url__ and this __url__
to the form _eqn_
_SOS_ for example a
when i read it
_SOS_ in the quantum
be new here _EOS_
's not like you
the condition _cite_ _EOS_
fourier transform of the
i 've only ever
_SOS_ these equations are
_SOS_ you 're my
i do not like
to a set of
_SOS_ the present paper
to me and i
brane at _eqn_ _EOS_
have to try that
in this limit _eqn_
it looks like they
_eqn_ is no longer
what to do with
_SOS_ we have considered
was talking about _EOS_
_SOS_ so you think
as functions of _eqn_
function _eqn_ is defined
what the fuck i
i 'm so happy
the zero mode _eqn_
consider for example the
no idea what that
_cite_ we can write
i can do that
but i like the
presence of the _eqn_
_SOS_ mine too _EOS_
_SOS_ we define a
_eqn_ implies that the
so you can n't
according to _eqn_ _EOS_
some of us are
_SOS_ no not really
to be more precise
is obtained from _eqn_
out of your element
did n't even see
under the gauge transformation
guess it 's a
which is proportional to
_SOS_ i would imagine
_SOS_ this provides a
_SOS_ you are awesome
_SOS_ he 's in
_eqn_ can be used
the running of the
was part of the
in general it is
more like this __url__
_SOS_ _cite_ in this
who are you _EOS_
_SOS_ alright i 'll
_SOS_ the simplest way
thank you kindly _EOS_
the _eqn_ or _eqn_
_eqn_ in front of
went better than expected
to give you a
we are in the
i 'll make sure
of the green s
_SOS_ i try to
organization of this paper
i did n't understand
in the supersymmetric case
or may not be
we write down the
where can i find
_eqn_ with _eqn_ are
he 's the one
a massless scalar field
for some reason this
're at it _EOS_
we will restrict ourselves
are given in table
laughed so hard at
_eqn_ of _eqn_ in
i have to do
_SOS_ we have discussed
a few months _EOS_
from _cite_ we obtain
in the usa _EOS_
_SOS_ so i 'm
the _eqn_ can be
a lot of work
is reminiscent of the
_SOS_ in figure _cite_
_eqn_ i e the
i was n't trying
_SOS_ the latter can
can n't afford to
_SOS_ you were n't
that the effective action
is devoted to a
you have to get
_SOS_ try this __url__
with the aid of
_SOS_ thanks i just
depends on the choice
can be seen to
do you have the
did n't get to
the replacement _eqn_ _EOS_
_eqn_ as expected _EOS_
used to be _EOS_
_SOS_ below we will
to hang out with
_SOS_ oh god _EOS_
green s functions _EOS_
_SOS_ it 's quite
the _eqn_ sector _EOS_
_SOS_ to study the
why did i click
as _eqn_ which is
doing the same thing
solution for _eqn_ is
yes yes i do
i 've never tried
the kernel of _eqn_
_SOS_ the authors would
_SOS_ does n't work
authors would like to
_SOS_ note that since
to be exact _EOS_
i looked at the
the mass parameter _eqn_
_eqn_ are independent of
i 've heard the
_SOS_ the coefficient _eqn_
that 's going to
_SOS_ you can just
the formulation of the
_SOS_ do n't mind
consider first the case
_SOS_ you know how
boundary conditions at the
can be obtained _EOS_
n't think of anything
read the article _EOS_
the _eqn_ wzw model
in the ns sector
those of us who
's going on _EOS_
_SOS_ it is only
if you 're into
the coordinate _eqn_ _EOS_
'm an idiot _EOS_
by the formula _eqn_
_SOS_ section _cite_ is
i know it was
_SOS_ oh wow that
and _eqn_ or _eqn_
there would be no
we have already mentioned
especially if you 're
the spontaneous breaking of
_SOS_ _ix_ of _cite_
and get back to
the terms of the
you say that like
_SOS_ i feel that
is replaced by the
_eqn_ expansion of the
what is that _EOS_
_SOS_ i found a
contained in _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ good to hear
be represented as _eqn_
_SOS_ i can get
thus there is no
's good to know
the problem of finding
term on the r
what 's with the
_SOS_ there are however
care to explain _EOS_
_SOS_ so if i
_cite_ one finds that
_SOS_ our goal is
could n't find the
fuck did i just
the knowledge of the
_SOS_ so in the
made it to the
for quite some time
we give a brief
in a recent paper
talk about it _EOS_
i 'm guessing the
will see that this
between the _eqn_ and
take the time to
are you sure it
iia string theory _EOS_
_SOS_ which one _EOS_
to the description of
can be presented as
check that out _EOS_
at the origin _eqn_
do you feel about
of the eigenvalues of
the girl in the
's shit like this
aim of the present
_ix_ of ref _EOS_
do n't hurt me
_SOS_ yes but that
using the results of
it 's the most
respectively _eqn_ and _eqn_
'm a big fan
time dependence of the
because of it _EOS_
of the de sitter
can be easily seen
the funniest thing i
in the complex _eqn_
to watch the world
are a bunch of
the notation of _cite_
it is based on
there seems to be
_SOS_ you too _EOS_
of the eleven dimensional
do n't get this
evolution of the universe
_SOS_ no that would
_SOS_ we show the
the case _eqn_ we
what i thought of
_SOS_ i 'll keep
the simplest way to
is the _eqn_ dimensional
just do n't have
as compared to the
then you do n't
that 's true i
we put _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ let us return
given in section _EOS_
said it was a
by doe grant de
_SOS_ so i guess
_SOS_ the chern simons
n't have to worry
of the potential is
note that the above
yeah i 'm pretty
_SOS_ if only it
of the paper we
symmetries of the theory
think it 's because
one loop level _EOS_
worry about it _EOS_
_SOS_ the important point
have no idea i
_SOS_ do n't listen
_SOS_ since it is
_SOS_ true but the
the kinetic term for
but this is a
mass term for the
's not like i
the warp factor _eqn_
i 've done that
rewritten in the form
_SOS_ the generalization to
not that there 's
_SOS_ according to this
_SOS_ yeah you can
is identical to that
now i 'm going
even if you do
of the metric and
_eqn_ and so the
mean like this __url__
it a try _EOS_
the vector _eqn_ is
_SOS_ there are n't
on the structure of
do you want me
the sense that the
_SOS_ upvote for your
the convergence of the
_SOS_ we have therefore
what would you like
do this all the
on the chan paton
_SOS_ what was it
the boundary conditions on
at the points _eqn_
i can attest to
i get the feeling
is a set of
of type _eqn_ _EOS_
wow that 's a
a lot of it
we can set _eqn_
's what you 're
that the right hand
let me tell you
remarks are in order
case of _eqn_ we
n't have time to
because there is no
the expression _cite_ for
an infinite set of
of my favorite movies
_SOS_ we get _eqn_
_SOS_ yes i would
as an example consider
it 's about the
is a reference to
it is more convenient
_SOS_ the path integral
the other day and
make it to the
_SOS_ yep i 'm
as far as we
know about you but
see also ref _EOS_
_SOS_ that too _EOS_
values of the parameters
_SOS_ same here and
fact that _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ well do n't
would like to make
in my mouth _EOS_
which can be written
_eqn_ is nothing but
that i have n't
but that would be
the change in the
_eqn_ and eq _EOS_
i do n't doubt
it when i was
the metric can be
i 'll take your
by setting _eqn_ _EOS_
what have i done
the form of eq
think it 's pretty
_SOS_ i have two
the cases _eqn_ and
it would be pretty
of the coefficients _eqn_
in _cite_ _eqn_ _EOS_
you can n't say
_SOS_ thanks i had
there is no _eqn_
if you 're being
in the limit where
have no idea where
of the _eqn_ functions
it 's so much
the bianchi identity _eqn_
doe grant de fg02
i 'm not seeing
_SOS_ one does not
_eqn_ subject to the
of the type i
was trying to make
_eqn_ _eqn_ where the
i 've only been
speaks the truth _EOS_
the matrix model _EOS_
function _eqn_ where _eqn_
it reminded me of
one finds _eqn_ _EOS_
you did n't say
_SOS_ damn you beat
determined by _eqn_ _EOS_
the action can be
when i 'm not
_SOS_ oh do n't
can be replaced by
_SOS_ in principle the
it 's impossible to
i 'd much rather
the other hand there
'm talking about _EOS_
that appear in the
_SOS_ the _eqn_ dimensional
guess i 'll just
the _eqn_ model is
what did you do
_SOS_ to complete the
if i can n't
_SOS_ hey everybody this
physical interpretation of the
_SOS_ he 's also
the _eqn_ terms in
a basis of _eqn_
and that 's a
it would be more
the first part of
_SOS_ i would assume
it is also interesting
values of _eqn_ for
what do you expect
_eqn_ can be computed
in that case you
_SOS_ thus we get
at least you have
go fuck yourself _EOS_
in aid for scientific
_SOS_ would you say
to the so called
lot of fun _EOS_
the phase space of
have been able to
the seiberg witten curve
_SOS_ thanks it was
will turn out to
have n't tried it
in the main text
is pretty good _EOS_
the source of the
_SOS_ yeah i mean
with the result of
_eqn_ and that the
all you need is
_SOS_ damn beat me
in anti de sitter
_SOS_ i 've used
note that there are
of generality we can
think it means what
_SOS_ this gives us
does n't even make
_SOS_ in the language
n't stop laughing _EOS_
have _eqn_ and the
it the first time
i came here for
is then _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ i found the
_SOS_ the _eqn_ _eqn_
of _eqn_ which are
you need to know
at the center of
want to do it
been there done that
for each _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ this is similar
that 's right _EOS_
_eqn_ or _eqn_ in
i 'm a huge
_SOS_ i use a
_eqn_ and _eqn_ there
his name is robert
the authors would like
in the complex plane
where do you think
gauge theory with _eqn_
right now it 's
_SOS_ i knew this
the central charge _EOS_
a matter of time
solutions _eqn_ and _eqn_
_SOS_ the question of
is so much better
and _eqn_ at _eqn_
i can get a
'm not sure it
is not well defined
_SOS_ it was probably
associated with _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ then you are
generalized to the case
_SOS_ sounds good i
paper we consider the
for what it 's
the limit of the
because i can n't
case when _eqn_ is
_eqn_ means that the
in that case _EOS_
of the electric field
with the rest of
it 's sort of
that the equations of
_SOS_ i was more
field strength of the
_SOS_ of _cite_ is
for this one _EOS_
've seen in a
discussed in the literature
_SOS_ do n't ask
the theory can be
_SOS_ if you go
is the same for
_cite_ where it was
to say it 's
_SOS_ the _eqn_ model
and i want to
fact that _eqn_ and
who gives a shit
is possible to find
sure you do n't
but there 's no
if _eqn_ is even
_SOS_ you are an
transformations _eqn_ where _eqn_
n't be the only
theory of gravity _EOS_
i know that i
in the particular case
the physical degrees of
to make sure it
_SOS_ then using the
i know i do
_SOS_ i smell a
in the number of
it sounds like you
the string theory _EOS_
why do you hate
a relation between the
one has _eqn_ where
one of the only
the target space _EOS_
think of the children
of the sigma model
you 're not supposed
of the stress energy
take a picture of
i did n't expect
of the m theory
the existence of _eqn_
well at least you
are _eqn_ with _eqn_
can n't be that
_SOS_ i 'd never
two and three point
i think it has
to the _eqn_ dimensional
out of you _EOS_
the first and the
n't upvote this enough
we define _eqn_ _EOS_
as long as there
commutation relations of the
have no idea who
shown in figure _EOS_
as an example of
because it does n't
_SOS_ i feel you
the dual field theory
express _eqn_ in terms
for the offer though
_eqn_ the solution is
wish there was a
it will be convenient
that was a great
been considered in _cite_
no one wants to
's the only one
to the one loop
yeah i 've been
some properties of the
yuno y u no
_SOS_ in the gauge
i read it _EOS_
let us calculate the
the part where he
a week or so
however in this case
i think a lot
in two different ways
_SOS_ the possibility of
_SOS_ who is this
in this theory _EOS_
what you 're trying
case there is no
my point is that
_SOS_ so am i
in the momentum space
_SOS_ now i know
_cite_ can also be
it should be possible
such thing as a
_SOS_ thus there are
what you 're doing
by taking the limit
to see this _EOS_
_SOS_ it is i
at zero temperature _EOS_
for _eqn_ and for
have to have a
we will discuss this
_SOS_ the ads cft
dick in crazy _EOS_
it should be stressed
you can find it
that 's true _EOS_
the indices _eqn_ and
's a link to
one loop correction to
is the metric of
this is true i
as i know _EOS_
at order _eqn_ _EOS_
they 're talking about
that i 've seen
where _eqn_ can be
and i think it
the domain wall _EOS_
_SOS_ scriptstyle _eqn_ _EOS_
n't have the same
is much smaller than
that is a great
do you think he
in the center of
out in ref _EOS_
that when i was
first two terms in
you know i 'm
but at least it
related to _eqn_ by
_SOS_ now i want
in this context the
n't want to live
the hilbert space _EOS_
i 've never used
natural to expect that
how many times i
the coulomb branch _EOS_
the expression of _eqn_
you 're interested _EOS_
we now proceed to
worth a shot _EOS_
of the self dual
what i was expecting
because of the _eqn_
is a lot more
the action is _eqn_
wish i could have
is in contrast to
no matter what _EOS_
_SOS_ forever alone _EOS_
be seen as a
_eqn_ the operator _eqn_
want to believe _EOS_
_SOS_ the inclusion of
_SOS_ yes and it
be independent of _eqn_
such a thing as
every time i hear
where _eqn_ and we
_eqn_ at large _eqn_
you want to know
_SOS_ this model has
going to be in
_SOS_ i see no
_cite_ and _cite_ have
of motion can be
you 'll get a
i have it on
the algebra of _eqn_
it went through try
of the solution is
the topology of _eqn_
you 've never heard
for this reason the
to hear it _EOS_
but you did n't
described in section _cite_
is the case of
someone who does n't
_SOS_ the _eqn_ theory
_SOS_ would you be
make sure it 's
the present work we
the set _eqn_ of
to hear that _EOS_
it is now _EOS_
presented in this paper
i am so glad
of the _eqn_ orbifold
_cite_ that _eqn_ _EOS_
just a bunch of
exactly what i 'm
is shown to be
coulomb branch of the
where do you get
_SOS_ mother of god
the brane world _EOS_
_SOS_ the metric _cite_
there would be a
people that do n't
this section we show
_SOS_ finally we note
_SOS_ some people are
_SOS_ not sure but
hilbert space _eqn_ _EOS_
is that the _eqn_
what 's that _EOS_
_SOS_ the second one
mean you people _EOS_
in my pants _EOS_
the intersection of the
_SOS_ first consider the
much better than the
_SOS_ therefore one can
when i read your
i wanted to say
the expressions for _eqn_
explicit expression for the
n't want to go
side of _cite_ is
_SOS_ jokes on you
_SOS_ so let us
no that 's the
one can find the
as long as he
the coset _eqn_ _EOS_
elements of _eqn_ are
thats what she said
also relevant __url__ _EOS_
will show that this
_SOS_ the most important
_SOS_ we did n't
_eqn_ here _eqn_ _EOS_
i think i love
fuck you that 's
to _eqn_ in _cite_
's the spirit _EOS_
in this work _EOS_
either way it 's
for the gauge fields
presented in ref _EOS_
the next day _EOS_
_SOS_ the meaning of
i hate when people
thanks for the input
the restriction of _eqn_
_SOS_ holy shit this
_eqn_ reduces to the
i really like this
the previous sections _EOS_
in figure _cite_ we
n't argue with that
an example of such
_SOS_ i 'd still
in the lie algebra
_SOS_ i may be
of the well known
're thinking of a
that the set of
've ever read _EOS_
two copies of the
n't seem to find
obtained from _cite_ by
_SOS_ did you try
the strong coupling regime
case i e _EOS_
to the discussion _EOS_
be a good idea
of the background field
_SOS_ i will have
orthogonal to _eqn_ _EOS_
's not like they
the energy density is
_eqn_ is in fact
thank you that 's
just in case you
where _eqn_ denotes a
let us consider now
this __url__ is a
i 'm not getting
of _cite_ to the
_SOS_ i 've gotten
of the manuscript _EOS_
's not the point
as given in _cite_
_SOS_ all i can
_cite_ that _eqn_ is
are supposed to be
very close to the
_SOS_ the two point
n't even think of
_SOS_ holy shit it
the boundary conditions of
going to say this
we will use this
part of it _EOS_
the dirac operator _eqn_
is more convenient to
u mad bro _EOS_
_eqn_ see e g
what the hell are
_SOS_ what 's this
is in terms of
how long did it
the two sets of
_SOS_ in the region
to find out what
_SOS_ i 'm already
when _eqn_ we have
need to make a
this can also be
testa meme detected upvoting
to see how the
_SOS_ especially if you
for a scalar field
_SOS_ let us call
be a lot of
_SOS_ i hope the
case there is a
it has something to
this case _eqn_ _EOS_
be done in the
i do n't usually
is the first thing
one obtains the following
_SOS_ we present the
do n't think any
a good day _EOS_
of solutions of the
_SOS_ this is going
lowest order in _eqn_
_SOS_ we refer the
have you been to
_SOS_ im not sure
we also discuss the
_SOS_ you do not
on the sphere _EOS_
are not the same
with _eqn_ supersymmetry _EOS_
i think they were
identify _eqn_ with _eqn_
_cite_ has the form
do n't believe it
_SOS_ you 'll get
conformal field theory is
_SOS_ context __url__ _EOS_
m theory compactified on
in four dimensions the
it for the first
_cite_ in this case
i guess i did
expressed as _eqn_ where
it was more of
'm going to start
the time dependence of
the structure constants of
took me a minute
at least i 'm
commutes with _eqn_ _EOS_
i just realized that
the t hooft coupling
can write _eqn_ _EOS_
have n't been able
'm not even sure
find that _eqn_ is
_SOS_ we will study
thank you i 've
do n't even want
this paper we are
to the low energy
he 's in the
is based on a
_eqn_ we have that
makes a lot of
're out of your
by the relation _eqn_
order terms in the
the best thing i
'm gonna have to
ministry of education science
's a picture of
can be realized as
of the time i
_SOS_ no she 's
one can calculate the
and if you 're
be reduced to the
i try not to
of the metric _cite_
_SOS_ the bosonic part
which is why it
_SOS_ which can be
who does n't _EOS_
be a dick _EOS_
with the boundary condition
_SOS_ spoken like a
_SOS_ the free energy
_SOS_ then why do
here we consider the
_cite_ we obtain _cite_
i 've got some
_SOS_ here we present
i had n't thought
_SOS_ high five _EOS_
m theory _cite_ _EOS_
i 've only seen
should be possible to
it 's safe to
listed in table _cite_
_SOS_ the sum over
this made my day
_SOS_ and then they
it will be useful
he did n't even
the field equations of
example of such a
who was phone _EOS_
equal to _eqn_ and
you 're an asshole
_eqn_ and thus the
on my way to
have nothing to do
terms of _eqn_ the
not that bad _EOS_
with the number of
that we need to
this sounds like a
guess i do n't
we obtain _cite_ _EOS_
_eqn_ will be denoted
i really can n't
know what they say
of d branes in
in the proof of
so i guess it
_SOS_ get off my
of the s matrix
the end of section
you 're a good
came to post this
the open string spectrum
_eqn_ of _cite_ _EOS_
know how to do
a gauge transformation _EOS_
see you there _EOS_
this guy has a
_SOS_ i suppose that
we can think of
_eqn_ is not an
is i do n't
and in part by
would n't have to
_SOS_ cannot unsee _EOS_
integers _eqn_ and _eqn_
i wonder if the
_SOS_ pretty sure the
see that there is
how much do you
is determined by _eqn_
no not at all
that the moduli space
_SOS_ haha i do
for the non abelian
be treated as a
haha i do n't
_SOS_ yuno y u
brane is given by
i should have been
notice that in the
_SOS_ oh well that
of the angular momentum
of the field _EOS_
so what 's the
did n't see anything
orders in _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ there are plenty
the schwarzschild black hole
does it work _EOS_
that the value of
it 's in a
the commutation relations _eqn_
_SOS_ another way to
n't think there 's
_SOS_ i 've played
the boundary of ads
can be found _EOS_
this is what it
_eqn_ and _eqn_ were
need to get a
_SOS_ it 's at
on the form of
at least one of
do n't know whether
is _eqn_ for _eqn_
the world burn _EOS_
guess i did n't
of the product of
_SOS_ can we get
in _ix_ and _ix_
and thank you for
'll give you a
elements _eqn_ and _eqn_
do not appear in
why do you ask
_SOS_ please do _EOS_
the commutation relations _cite_
can do that _EOS_
where the _eqn_ s
btz black hole _EOS_
you are n't a
_SOS_ i just found
defined as _eqn_ and
at the time i
of the casimir energy
be represented in the
it makes me sad
_SOS_ we introduce a
n't think you can
are you serious _EOS_
obtained by setting _eqn_
all you have to
equations _eqn_ and _eqn_
_SOS_ i would do
the same result as
i 'm used to
loss of generality _EOS_
_SOS_ therefore _eqn_ and
reminded me of the
_SOS_ figure _cite_ shows
_SOS_ well then you
i have the weirdest
the _eqn_ _eqn_ plane
they correspond to the
what if it 's
fixed point of the
trying to think of
i 'll show you
representation _eqn_ of the
_eqn_ are invariant under
just trying to be
_SOS_ oh yeah that
us note that the
_SOS_ i actually thought
_SOS_ the extension of
funniest thing i 've
right hand side _EOS_
by using eq _EOS_
it 's more than
_eqn_ can be expanded
do do do do
think there is a
this is also the
_SOS_ note that _cite_
as opposed to the
_SOS_ oh thank you
_cite_ we arrive at
_SOS_ i think what
of the set of
did you even read
to the calculation of
as i 'm concerned
near the horizon _EOS_
if you go to
part of the lagrangian
algebra of functions on
you are referring to
on the sign of
since i do n't
are one of the
was proposed in _cite_
i 've seen some
the isometry group of
_SOS_ i really liked
in that case we
but it 's so
discussions and comments _EOS_
_SOS_ fixed __url__ _EOS_
_eqn_ is the standard
a piece of shit
let us focus on
_SOS_ no such thing
the condition for the
'd be happy to
_eqn_ can be taken
have a look at
of _eqn_ and of
have defined _eqn_ _EOS_
i know you _EOS_
_SOS_ no it would
where _eqn_ are arbitrary
no it is not
variation with respect to
it is not _EOS_
that the first term
consequence of the fact
you have to admit
the m bius strip
yes yes yes yes
_SOS_ this case is
agree with you but
i doing it right
of _eqn_ that is
_SOS_ it 's his
of the star product
_SOS_ i 'm working
the radius _eqn_ of
_SOS_ you 're wrong
the space of _eqn_
be consistent with the
the same thing and
that there 's anything
this section we present
_SOS_ oh no you
let us start from
_SOS_ i did i
to all orders _EOS_
the charge conjugation matrix
you think you are
i second this motion
science foundation under grant
the solutions of _cite_
you mean you people
_SOS_ now we would
_SOS_ this man speaks
_SOS_ as we discussed
a couple of weeks
_SOS_ that would have
we will consider only
all the time it
the set of _eqn_
_SOS_ your name is
contribution to the effective
_SOS_ can you give
can see that _eqn_
of the riemann tensor
the best of us
laughed so hard i
the string coupling _eqn_
_SOS_ i still think
where _eqn_ is _eqn_
_eqn_ we obtain _cite_
you a wizard _EOS_
_SOS_ this is easily
i know it is
_cite_ we find _cite_
hate it when people
_eqn_ or _eqn_ the
that was my favorite
_SOS_ why does n't
the second term on
_SOS_ for each _eqn_
so that 's a
_SOS_ the metric _eqn_
_SOS_ wow thank you
_SOS_ damn straight _EOS_
four dimensional space time
_SOS_ more like the
and _cite_ in the
do n't have time
example let us consider
as in _cite_ the
i 'm out of
_SOS_ in the low
_SOS_ there will be
in a few years
the _eqn_ group _EOS_
you are doing it
_SOS_ i wish there
_SOS_ the hilbert space
_SOS_ just out of
_eqn_ are in the
as _eqn_ _eqn_ and
be a problem _EOS_
_SOS_ we now proceed
you feel any better
of the sine gordon
this is amazing _EOS_
in the text _EOS_
what is the difference
_SOS_ yes i can
boundary conditions of the
_cite_ we have to
do n't mind _EOS_
so they do n't
us now discuss the
_SOS_ how you doin
_SOS_ the _eqn_ matrix
can be eliminated by
n c e p
commute with each other
on the internet is
n't change the fact
parameters _eqn_ _eqn_ and
_SOS_ _ix_ can be
_SOS_ it was actually
electric and magnetic charges
i had to google
put it on the
the fact that this
_SOS_ i am glad
the couplings of the
_SOS_ reminded me of
on the lattice _EOS_
_SOS_ the real question
is related to a
_SOS_ note that it
it 's better to
if you 're using
in the preceding section
_eqn_ is a gauge
story of my life
_SOS_ i suppose i
of the solutions of
_SOS_ no do n't
for _eqn_ _eqn_ for
_eqn_ this means that
it 's possible to
and that is why
we obtain _eqn_ the
be determined by the
i never said it
_SOS_ in addition _eqn_
_SOS_ just so you
by the pixels _EOS_
with central charge _eqn_
can n't get a
need to know the
_SOS_ _cite_ we will
do n't want it
_SOS_ it 's great
_SOS_ there have been
it is important that
must have been a
if they were n't
to the mass of
i always thought that
in the commutative limit
_SOS_ and i thought
we come to the
_SOS_ if only there
equation for _eqn_ is
could n't help but
_SOS_ next consider the
damn beat me to
of _eqn_ respectively _EOS_
that 's not very
finally we note that
know what you are
not to mention that
we have not yet
_eqn_ we note that
it means what you
i was just curious
is defined as a
_SOS_ can n't upvote
are of the same
'm with you on
on the case of
as a special case
mind me asking _EOS_
_SOS_ it was more
different from the one
degrees of freedom _eqn_
it a lot _EOS_
_SOS_ damn i was
is non zero _EOS_
_SOS_ thanks now i
of the variable _eqn_
_SOS_ this gives rise
well i 'll be
as do i _EOS_
one loop _eqn_ function
see _cite_ for details
that part of the
in the dark _EOS_
regions _eqn_ and _eqn_
degrees of freedom which
i think we need
shit you 're right
would like to acknowledge
_SOS_ those are the
can be used as
_SOS_ the above discussion
that is not the
_eqn_ is a normalization
i was being sarcastic
've probably never heard
_eqn_ _cite_ and _eqn_
all i see is
non bps d brane
does not commute with
n't get it either
but i feel like
in _cite_ we can
make me want to
on the _eqn_ brane
obtained in this way
you 're saying that
a shit ton of
part of _eqn_ is
_SOS_ yeah but then
of the space _eqn_
_SOS_ do you not
_eqn_ there is an
_SOS_ i 'll bet
factor of _eqn_ in
is a hell of
the reduced phase space
i think i got
the lines of _cite_
and we see that
i found it on
are a number of
i have one of
out of this _EOS_
will restrict ourselves to
point of view it
was a kid _EOS_
have found that the
unless it 's a
_SOS_ did someone say
_eqn_ becomes _eqn_ _EOS_
have a seat over
the case for _eqn_
and _eqn_ are functions
i 'll be back
_cite_ for more details
that needs to be
of the hamiltonian _EOS_
the quality of the
for a second i
in this section is
i swear to god
what happens in the
i 'm just curious
to the question of
better understanding of the
i 've seen all
_SOS_ in particular they
i could n't resist
first world problems _EOS_
the breaking of the
_SOS_ well i can
the yang mills action
_eqn_ and _eqn_ when
to pay for it
_SOS_ sorry i did
abelian gauge theory _EOS_
_SOS_ i dont get
second term on the
have n't had a
we have _eqn_ in
is it bad that
zero mode of the
'm sorry to hear
_SOS_ when _eqn_ _eqn_
how can you tell
in other words it
_SOS_ looks like we
under _eqn_ and _eqn_
_eqn_ is the space
have you ever tried
_SOS_ we will give
for a few minutes
's not it 's
the three point functions
_SOS_ well of course
this case the _eqn_
seems like it would
the solution in the
_SOS_ i appreciate the
from that of the
_SOS_ the funny thing
_SOS_ the near horizon
the funny thing is
for the effective action
you have any idea
_SOS_ it is if
space i e _EOS_
the action with respect
it and it 's
the lagrangian _cite_ _EOS_
for me i 'm
is obvious that the
a couple years ago
in the rest frame
do n't mind if
in this model the
_SOS_ now let _eqn_
be able to see
_SOS_ sounds like someone
group of _eqn_ _EOS_
_eqn_ or _eqn_ for
because it 's the
know what that is
metric _eqn_ and the
can be found from
just thinking about it
of both _eqn_ and
i think he just
speed of light _EOS_
the solution of this
drink my own piss
parameters of the theory
the fuck is that
the work of s
and taking into account
it is a great
depends on what you
the number of states
_SOS_ if they were
_SOS_ the boundary condition
_SOS_ okay i 'll
_SOS_ the quantities _eqn_
i think there is
in the lagrangian _EOS_
_SOS_ it was argued
_SOS_ that depends on
n't tell if trolling
this case there are
_SOS_ we will focus
_SOS_ yes yes they
has not yet been
of my all time
has been used _EOS_
one or the other
_SOS_ wow thanks for
_eqn_ while _eqn_ _EOS_
is the best thing
it is worth mentioning
and so _eqn_ _EOS_
it would still be
i was wrong _EOS_
of each other _EOS_
_SOS_ _cite_ as a
_SOS_ i was like
but i guess i
invariant under the transformations
_SOS_ in the remainder
have n't been to
over and over and
the present work _EOS_
in here to say
the relation _cite_ _EOS_
have to do is
of the universe is
in terms of two
you 're being sarcastic
i 'm in love
the possibility of a
've ever heard _EOS_
a subset of the
do n't have anything
us assume that the
is kind of a
now show that the
_eqn_ is small _EOS_
did n't know they
by _cite_ with _eqn_
i want one _EOS_
_SOS_ ok i 'm
_eqn_ are of the
_SOS_ of course one
it 's the one
next section we shall
out of them _EOS_
so say we all
terms in _eqn_ _EOS_
it you do n't
of the extra dimensions
_SOS_ in appendix _cite_
did n't need to
can n't find any
of the brane is
are taken to be
does n't know how
and _eqn_ corresponds to
you i did n't
let us study the
they 're the same
on _eqn_ i e
to think about it
i have never been
the result is that
do you mean the
the surface _eqn_ _EOS_
're doing it right
the equivalence between the
fuck that shit _EOS_
the action in the
as a child _EOS_
the scalar fields _eqn_
_SOS_ i watched that
to _eqn_ at _eqn_
_SOS_ where the hell
in reference _cite_ _EOS_
_SOS_ and it is
be summarized as follows
in terms of which
read this in the
ad ad ad ad
yeah but that 's
_SOS_ notice that we
that does n't really
for your help _EOS_
there are a number
_eqn_ and or _eqn_
do n't really understand
_SOS_ haha no i
_SOS_ the k hler
was done in _cite_
_SOS_ ever heard of
_SOS_ in sect we
to see if anyone
we can write down
_SOS_ let us next
it made me laugh
must have _eqn_ _EOS_
the end of a
_SOS_ no kidding i
in the first term
the derivative of _eqn_
you missed the point
of _eqn_ corresponds to
when you 're not
do i know you
this is what we
does that make me
in a natural way
_SOS_ and they 're
in _eqn_ _eqn_ and
_SOS_ yeah same here
it is of interest
_SOS_ i love when
the matrices _eqn_ are
i want to _EOS_
in the higgs phase
_SOS_ in the original
that 's probably why
_SOS_ there has been
i read this comment
_SOS_ right you are
_eqn_ into eq _EOS_
i have but one
we have constructed the
as well it 's
of the metric is
_SOS_ thanks i have
the effective cosmological constant
did n't notice the
the space of all
and the _eqn_ are
to the end of
_SOS_ i 'm starting
_eqn_ can be described
for this is that
i have no problem
by taking into account
oh i 'm sorry
i would have thought
string coupling constant _eqn_
_SOS_ in fact a
really do n't think
it was worth it
turns out that this
having a hard time
strong coupling limit of
does not satisfy the
i just think it
do it all the
low energy dynamics of
_eqn_ is not the
you 're such a
i 'm sure she
the _eqn_ superconformal algebra
make it look like
the proof of this
_SOS_ the limit _eqn_
do n't understand this
moduli space _eqn_ of
that is a very
it 's sad that
the lowest landau level
_SOS_ looks like they
as a starting point
first order in the
well i did n't
_SOS_ just wait until
be proportional to the
black hole _cite_ _EOS_
that 's how they
maybe i 'm just
we use the same
the transformation of _eqn_
you can n't _EOS_
_SOS_ the same way
in section we show
_SOS_ i honestly do
of the boundary _EOS_
something along those lines
the analytic continuation of
gauge symmetry of the
it is the only
analytic continuation of the
have to admit that
_SOS_ i think if
in field theory _EOS_
if i wanted to
the gauge group of
i 'll make a
is a symmetry of
for the purposes of
i know i have
_SOS_ is there an
the ansatz for the
_SOS_ no i meant
the vector fields _eqn_
the representation theory of
wrong with me _EOS_
_SOS_ it has a
as in section _cite_
_SOS_ no problem it
are found to be
in the description of
it would be awesome
i dont get it
if _eqn_ is odd
_eqn_ and _eqn_ since
they do n't make
_SOS_ i watched the
on the brane world
detailed analysis of the
yes you are _EOS_
i will check it
same way as the
_eqn_ one has to
if you are in
more than a few
term of the form
as explained in the
the matter fields _EOS_
then it would be
it would be an
value of _eqn_ for
at this point i
the d3 branes _EOS_
under the gauge transformations
_SOS_ the equations _cite_
hey everybody this guy
_SOS_ you may have
the origin of this
_SOS_ could you elaborate
means that there is
_SOS_ similarly we can
do n't exist _EOS_
did n't think that
now consider the case
_SOS_ they should have
to lowest order in
_eqn_ for the case
a look at the
_eqn_ components of the
the casimir energy of
for making me laugh
the harmonic function _eqn_
_SOS_ what did he
is not unique _EOS_
be written in a
n't find it _EOS_
that the matrix _eqn_
when i do n't
n't know what 's
the four dimensional effective
i have ever read
the result of this
_SOS_ probably because it
_SOS_ we may now
be able to play
on the space _eqn_
really looking forward to
the embedding of the
choose _eqn_ to be
do not think it
_SOS_ in a sense
to do with a
_SOS_ wedge _eqn_ _EOS_
you do n't believe
order in _eqn_ the
thank you lt _EOS_
the rhs of _cite_
this __url__ and this
_SOS_ if we 're
in _cite_ is a
a system of _eqn_
do n't let it
best of luck to
the information about the
the starting point of
thing i 've read
if i were a
of the center of
_eqn_ s _eqn_ _EOS_
thank you for not
all you need to
and _eqn_ given by
of the rg flow
was the last time
i thought she was
term of eq _EOS_
a calabi yau manifold
but i 'm glad
can be understood in
thank you i did
the following way _eqn_
_SOS_ the last two
a lot of sense
me too i was
we look at the
_SOS_ if you read
space is given by
live in the us
the context of _eqn_
_eqn_ we denote the
there 's more than
in section we describe
you very much for
_SOS_ not according to
that appears in the
_SOS_ we 've got
the worldvolume of the
i think its a
not difficult to show
_SOS_ only if the
_SOS_ the cosmological constant
it i 'm not
the form _eqn_ we
ring to it _EOS_
_SOS_ and i 'll
is the solution of
that was just a
for which _eqn_ is
let me guess you
_SOS_ although we have
what exactly do you
i read that _EOS_
in _cite_ with _eqn_
_SOS_ god i hope
figures _cite_ and _cite_
_SOS_ yes that was
of the value of
_SOS_ when i saw
does n't matter had
to thank prof _EOS_
_SOS_ well there is
on _eqn_ is _eqn_
in particular _eqn_ _EOS_
up with that _EOS_
_SOS_ we are also
because he does n't
_SOS_ how about this
the relation of the
in the final section
that 's the same
_SOS_ sorry but i
the high temperature limit
_SOS_ oh how i
identify _eqn_ with the
can be chosen to
see your point _EOS_
i suppose that 's
proceed as follows _EOS_
can be used in
yes that 's what
if that helps _EOS_
on a circle _EOS_
for a while but
values of _eqn_ we
are _eqn_ _eqn_ _eqn_
you never know _EOS_
_SOS_ our results are
good luck with your
_SOS_ there is only
of the model _cite_
_cite_ we conclude that
in the banana stand
of the boundary state
is it really that
the first step is
i completely forgot about
the anti self dual
in the conformal gauge
you thank you _EOS_
_SOS_ the evaluation of
see if you can
_SOS_ _eqn_ for _eqn_
how to do that
c combo breaker _EOS_
one can define the
_SOS_ we call the
say the least _EOS_
_SOS_ _cite_ it was
_SOS_ no way i
_SOS_ did you watch
_SOS_ here we give
_SOS_ so long as
_cite_ is equal to
_SOS_ the evolution of
i do that _EOS_
_SOS_ _cite_ is given
did n't say anything
_eqn_ is due to
it 's probably a
_SOS_ let us finally
be worth it _EOS_
_SOS_ in fact if
for a little while
_SOS_ if we set
on the way to
not too long ago
this is given by
no idea how to
the other hand one
'm still waiting for
the spin of the
_SOS_ _eqn_ _eqn_ and
did n't do it
for a while and
we will take the
_SOS_ in recent years
get that checked out
been shown that the
what he 's talking
those were the days
we are considering the
_SOS_ what if they
to see this let
it was pointed out
not a lot of
n't know anything about
to _eqn_ as _eqn_
i 've heard _EOS_
of the _eqn_ expansion
the boundary condition at
was n't in the
can then be written
well that 's not
_SOS_ well are n't
is that we have
_SOS_ that 's racist
to the d brane
_SOS_ i lived in
type iib theory _EOS_
_SOS_ i appreciate your
the first line of
_eqn_ there exists a
out of curiosity what
one can easily see
why do you have
for generic values of
it would be _EOS_
_SOS_ never forget _EOS_
_eqn_ gauge theories _EOS_
there is an additional
word for it _EOS_
every single one of
show that the _eqn_
iib string theory on
used to have a
real and imaginary parts
why not zoidberg _EOS_
see _cite_ and _cite_
thanks a ton _EOS_
_eqn_ from _cite_ _EOS_
i believe this is
_eqn_ is the momentum
see here __url__ _EOS_
_SOS_ it used to
_SOS_ we will take
_SOS_ would n't you
_eqn_ and then _eqn_
_SOS_ they are not
_SOS_ we write the
do it again _EOS_
localized on the brane
have _eqn_ where the
it would have to
i 'm sure if
term in the expansion
but i could be
the _eqn_ representation _EOS_
_SOS_ oh you mean
that _eqn_ is invariant
_SOS_ oh thank god
_SOS_ the general form
_SOS_ as a fellow
_SOS_ we see from
i can see why
of equation _cite_ _EOS_
the power of the
the derivatives of the
you 're just being
in view of this
well that 's the
change the fact that
that corresponds to the
_SOS_ i 'd buy
the remainder of the
but i 'd like
that _eqn_ _eqn_ _EOS_
greater than _eqn_ _EOS_
that thank you _EOS_
_eqn_ can be chosen
and a bunch of
algebra of _eqn_ _EOS_
and i had to
_SOS_ she does n't
now we would like
_SOS_ with this choice
does it mean _EOS_
_SOS_ in the light
_SOS_ looks like i
_SOS_ lol you 're
difference between the two
result is _eqn_ where
that is not a
in _eqn_ is _eqn_
that 's the most
_SOS_ nope just a
the d1 d5 system
i like the idea
it should be emphasized
are generated by the
i 'd do it
i 'm not quite
pointed out that the
_cite_ in the _eqn_
you are awesome _EOS_
can be extracted from
would if i could
_SOS_ i 'd give
note however that the
a huge mistake _EOS_
the zero slope limit
_SOS_ do n't give
_SOS_ the space time
abelian gauge theories _EOS_
does this have to
_SOS_ exactly it 's
acting on _eqn_ _EOS_
born and raised in
the existence of these
if that 's a
terms of the gauge
_eqn_ and _eqn_ gauge
i 've read all
there is a _eqn_
to be fair they
appears to be a
he will n't be
here i come _EOS_
to the one in
that 's all that
there has been a
_SOS_ do n't bother
and _eqn_ at the
_SOS_ it sure is
is _eqn_ with the
_SOS_ _cite_ gives the
agree with you on
_eqn_ is the dual
where did you find
_SOS_ it went through
to be proportional to
i 've come to
which is defined by
expression _cite_ for the
know how to make
given by _eqn_ this
n't think it is
the organization of the
want to know how
_cite_ it is clear
came here to make
joke 's on you
therefore _eqn_ and _eqn_
_SOS_ i dunno man
in _eqn_ _eqn_ _EOS_
to the point of
_eqn_ it is possible
thought it was an
_SOS_ i am very
the periodicity of the
solution of _cite_ _EOS_
to see if you
part of the gauge
was hoping for a
do n't make a
two terms in the
_SOS_ it 's got
is just _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ it 's kinda
algebras _eqn_ and _eqn_
and therefore _eqn_ _EOS_
kind of looks like
can be calculated by
we just do n't
on the hilbert space
seat over there _EOS_
a very long time
the following table _EOS_
_eqn_ with _eqn_ fixed
you think this is
_SOS_ we point out
was about to post
i look like a
let us see how
i still think it
such as _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ it is worthwhile
clearing that up _EOS_
far away from the
no i am not
_SOS_ it 's that
as one can see
but i thought it
the details of this
difference between _eqn_ and
have no problem with
of _eqn_ and is
that it 's just
get that a lot
here _eqn_ _eqn_ and
from the field theory
heard of them _EOS_
_SOS_ you 're on
the dual of the
and it is not
in case you did
case you did n't
the two form _eqn_
the functions _eqn_ _EOS_
you but i 'm
have the following form
that would n't be
is a solution to
you have to use
that _eqn_ if _eqn_
's it i 'm
that some of the
action _cite_ can be
a description of the
you 're not my
i have n't done
the following section _EOS_
matrix elements of _eqn_
n't know that i
's about it _EOS_
in _cite_ and we
to be the only
we can express the
i agree but i
in the case at
is going on _EOS_
the supersymmetry of the
i like this idea
order to make the
how could i forget
of the conformal group
n't see how that
of non abelian gauge
_SOS_ pretty sure you
momentum tensor of the
_SOS_ however if _eqn_
man speaks the truth
keep in mind that
will be referred to
_SOS_ i do like
other hand if _eqn_
figured out how to
we can assume that
_SOS_ lol i know
as we have mentioned
do n't make it
interpreted in terms of
commute with _eqn_ _EOS_
they 'd have to
_eqn_ is constant _EOS_
a nice day _EOS_
_SOS_ nope it was
in particular we can
_SOS_ do you ever
for the black hole
_SOS_ it 's no
not commute with the
given by _cite_ s
i 'm saying is
let us recall the
shit out of that
the combination _eqn_ _EOS_
was a bit of
in the bulk of
thank you sir i
_SOS_ that seems like
be seen in the
_SOS_ im pretty sure
we choose _eqn_ and
_eqn_ is the four
speak for yourself _EOS_
_SOS_ ha that 's
horizon at _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ hear hear _EOS_
_SOS_ let us describe
will be useful to
you are thinking of
to the standard model
you can n't go
_SOS_ in general there
the reddit enhancement suite
long did it take
units of _eqn_ _EOS_
is a great idea
terms in the expansion
_eqn_ this implies that
know exactly what you
and _eqn_ then _eqn_
what you mean i
_SOS_ til there is
_eqn_ up to _eqn_
effective field theory _EOS_
it 's worth a
and me both _EOS_
of _eqn_ must be
_SOS_ i looked at
the _eqn_ directions _EOS_
if it is a
order to determine the
_SOS_ did you have
given in section _cite_
_eqn_ from _eqn_ _EOS_
give it a go
_cite_ becomes _eqn_ where
it should be a
_SOS_ when i read
by replacing _eqn_ by
do n't do this
the magnetic field _eqn_
the gauss law constraint
there 's a good
_SOS_ not really it
solution of this equation
do you think of
recently there has been
_cite_ in the following
you on that one
i 'm not very
the brane and the
's a good point
_SOS_ as expected the
the parameters _eqn_ _eqn_
you are welcome _EOS_
i have n't found
we will give a
_SOS_ dude you 're
_SOS_ however if the
_SOS_ to show this
for the tip i
do you know it
we identify _eqn_ with
_cite_ coincides with the
i 'll be damned
's a lot more
is not the only
can n't even get
which appears in the
sure if you 're
the explicit expression for
_SOS_ at large _eqn_
to watch it _EOS_
in the twisted sector
make a rage comic
for me but i
to be compared with
n't think you 're
self dual yang mills
i never thought i
the requirement that _eqn_
the action _cite_ in
the first rule of
_SOS_ for this case
_SOS_ i would guess
_SOS_ to see how
i had never heard
_SOS_ it 's alright
_SOS_ yeah i like
by setting _eqn_ and
good day sir _EOS_
that the spectrum of
how the fuck do
is the generator of
if we define _eqn_
just about to say
and _eqn_ from the
n't even want to
the restriction of the
think of this __url__
_SOS_ the wave function
and i 'm in
_SOS_ you 're gonna
of the non perturbative
_SOS_ happy to help
it was argued in
_SOS_ do n't call
the set _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ see also _cite_
and i thought it
a lot better _EOS_
components of the metric
i have never had
the orbifold group _eqn_
_eqn_ which is _eqn_
and you 've got
_eqn_ for _eqn_ in
this is true but
_SOS_ in fact as
in the movie _EOS_
_eqn_ here _eqn_ are
this man speaks the
to be equivalent to
want to talk about
_SOS_ do n't feed
to zero as _eqn_
_SOS_ the inner product
_SOS_ what 's up
it 's not worth
the wave function of
have to wait for
wave function of the
one of those people
particular case of the
_SOS_ thus if _eqn_
i really did n't
and _eqn_ to the
do n't understand it
_SOS_ one can now
it must have been
i do this too
which implies _eqn_ _EOS_
_eqn_ is the ricci
the time of the
_SOS_ that reminds me
black hole horizon _EOS_
_SOS_ _cite_ on the
if i have to
i feel like you
the cardy verlinde formula
i heard it was
is such that the
nail on the head
the state _eqn_ _EOS_
and i think i
note that if _eqn_
_SOS_ actually i do
_SOS_ we also thank
but i 'm just
come back to this
do n't own a
valid for _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ to be specific
i have a hard
fields i e _EOS_
there as well _EOS_
'm in the same
it corresponds to a
by _eqn_ so that
to be at least
i clicked on the
supersymmetric extension of the
_SOS_ he must have
this way we obtain
_SOS_ hell yeah i
is also invariant under
_SOS_ ok thanks _EOS_
of this theory _EOS_
do you call a
then we have the
_SOS_ it then follows
_SOS_ today i learned
it 's funny _EOS_
the limit of small
_SOS_ yeah i really
the importance of the
n't know if that
zero modes in the
_eqn_ it is not
you are not a
at least you can
the influence of the
i actually did n't
of the horizon _EOS_
_SOS_ the gauge fixing
post the same thing
as well but i
the reason for the
_SOS_ yes i 've
we will show how
for the life of
in order to compare
for _eqn_ the _eqn_
he did n't _EOS_
_SOS_ same here it
the consequences of the
_SOS_ that 's fucking
dual to each other
differential equation for _eqn_
should have been more
spectrum of the _eqn_
would like a word
a power series in
but you beat me
could n't care less
is the metric on
_SOS_ thanks dude _EOS_
in part by a
a bit of an
the one loop contribution
on the brane _eqn_
rest of your life
_eqn_ we consider the
your argument is invalid
_SOS_ here we use
but they 're not
is shown in _cite_
most of the people
am i doing this
the low energy physics
_SOS_ the fuck is
from the analysis of
did you know _EOS_
in the world volume
_eqn_ is the area
the fact that she
a little bit more
fixed value of _eqn_
goes to zero _EOS_
of the particle _EOS_
was n't it _EOS_
for the fact that
the next subsection we
we 'll see _EOS_
_eqn_ namely _eqn_ _EOS_
one of my all
_SOS_ i bought a
_cite_ which is the
we obtain for the
you 're on a
expanded in terms of
with you on this
_SOS_ i have yet
by _eqn_ with the
_SOS_ looks like someone
asymptotically anti de sitter
that makes no sense
where part of this
the expression _cite_ is
_SOS_ sim _eqn_ _EOS_
that seems like a
_eqn_ are respectively the
n't think i 'd
i 'm at a
we have to use
now i 'm just
that the field _eqn_
definition of the _eqn_
hard at this _EOS_
is probably the best
made in _cite_ _EOS_
_SOS_ if you did
_cite_ in which the
_SOS_ does this mean
_SOS_ finally we consider
_SOS_ the results for
it 's cool _EOS_
a change of variables
have yet to see
_SOS_ we 're talking
we show how the
_SOS_ i only have
string theory on the
_SOS_ moreover _eqn_ is
i 'll just go
this is the main
what i 'm thinking
and you 'll get
in the upper half
i 'm a woman
the fields of the
_SOS_ the requirement of
he did n't get
_SOS_ we now have
watch the world burn
_SOS_ i always think
symmetric with respect to
i did n't go
such a case the
i 'd say he
see that it is
can do it _EOS_
de sitter space time
_SOS_ because _eqn_ is
so i guess i
in both cases _EOS_
in my experience _EOS_
_SOS_ therefore in this
do n't stick your
_SOS_ well they 're
gauge field _eqn_ and
n't be a dick
the einstein frame _EOS_
from here __url__ _EOS_
work was done _EOS_
_SOS_ note that as
a a a a
_SOS_ _cite_ so that
do you do _EOS_
_SOS_ the potential _eqn_
i was not aware
_SOS_ yes but not
the so called _eqn_
_SOS_ i suppose you
of the tachyon field
been supported by the
had to do it
the yang mills field
would make more sense
_SOS_ i just wish
function on _eqn_ _EOS_
in the asymptotic region
you can get the
_SOS_ must be a
is of interest to
and _eqn_ to _eqn_
thought it was going
_SOS_ the condition for
right now but i
_SOS_ well i 'd
is associated to the
_SOS_ i think people
respect to _eqn_ _eqn_
me too and i
space time dimensions _EOS_
sign me up _EOS_
we have shown how
_eqn_ _eqn_ _cite_ _EOS_
know what to say
physical meaning of the
say it 's a
i 'm happy to
modes _eqn_ and _eqn_
space time _eqn_ _EOS_
unfortunately i do n't
_SOS_ here 's one
the result is _EOS_
as the sum of
n't say that i
as shown in the
at all it 's
_SOS_ as an american
of _eqn_ and we
the one i was
we will now show
_SOS_ there 's something
play a role in
_SOS_ as a guy
the wess zumino term
_SOS_ here here _EOS_
the action on the
let 's do it
only on _eqn_ and
_SOS_ of course but
we shall refer to
_SOS_ i 'll admit
_SOS_ with the above
function _eqn_ is a
i 'm wrong but
free energy of the
laugh out loud _EOS_
not that i know
to the chern simons
_SOS_ what a twist
_eqn_ according to _cite_
_SOS_ i 'm about
a change of the
_SOS_ to illustrate the
here __url__ is a
that 's it thanks
the ministry of education
_cite_ we use the
the best i can
've never seen that
of _eqn_ and its
_SOS_ thats what she
theory living on the
he 's a good
the type iia string
i 'm not talking
need to consider the
's the link __url__
_SOS_ we have presented
that a lot _EOS_
this turns out to
_SOS_ you get an
of this type _EOS_
i gave you an
the sum is over
_SOS_ where the fuck
boundary conditions for _eqn_
_SOS_ it can n't
it is always possible
is a _eqn_ matrix
one of these _EOS_
_SOS_ link __url__ _EOS_
this paper is the
follows that _eqn_ and
read the whole thing
_SOS_ _cite_ and we
n't mean it 's
been a while since
part _eqn_ of the
_SOS_ i feel so
is not clear how
like to know this
the non bps d
an action of the
it 's definitely not
_SOS_ _cite_ for details
makes you feel any
the best i could
the yang mills coupling
i do i do
should be stressed that
are you saying you
we will be able
can be approximated by
i 'm such a
the generator of _eqn_
you would n't download
on the heterotic side
one way or another
_SOS_ this is like
the contribution of _eqn_
can n't be a
that _eqn_ is independent
is a very good
would be nice to
and move on _EOS_
that the one loop
_SOS_ the set _eqn_
a few minutes _EOS_
are in agreement with
it like that _EOS_
it is simple to
you 're not _EOS_
that there 's no
we will denote by
about a year ago
the integration constant _eqn_
i do n't hate
in the computation of
born infeld action _EOS_
_SOS_ the method of
but there is a
is what i meant
the other hand when
as a linear combination
i bet it 's
_SOS_ well that would
_eqn_ can then be
_SOS_ let us study
you seem to have
_SOS_ i actually think
however we do not
_SOS_ that is to
if i were to
_SOS_ in which case
replaced by _eqn_ and
same as in _cite_
this happened to me
_SOS_ depends on where
schwarzschild black hole _EOS_
_SOS_ maybe we should
in order to derive
and how do you
let us begin by
it is if you
provided that _eqn_ _EOS_
just going to say
_SOS_ if you say
supersymmetric gauge theories _EOS_
section _cite_ is devoted
the original post _EOS_
into _cite_ we find
pay for it _EOS_
i work at a
the algebra _eqn_ is
black hole solutions _EOS_
but he did n't
n't understand what you
we want to show
_SOS_ came in here
in the above expression
_SOS_ can you please
a combination of the
do n't blame you
we can derive the
to _eqn_ we obtain
yo dawg i heard
dawg i heard you
is the product of
did n't see any
theory on _eqn_ is
'll have to look
of a two dimensional
are invariant under _eqn_
i could n't stop
_SOS_ haha i love
the anomalous dimension of
the energy of a
with a name like
be able to make
some aspects of the
does n't care about
the pre big bang
_SOS_ if they do
are present in the
are located at _eqn_
are some of the
i did n't find
second term in eq
_SOS_ it 's easy
_SOS_ this yields _eqn_
and in particular the
that word i do
is a bitch _EOS_
to the gauge field
in fact one can
it was my first
_SOS_ he 's going
the divergent part of
_SOS_ but you do
_eqn_ branes in the
_SOS_ what we have
have a problem _EOS_
can you tell me
symmetry of the action
_SOS_ i would 've
gauge symmetry is broken
_SOS_ it is expected
_SOS_ no idea i
and it looks like
be interesting to find
in a similar fashion
know the answer to
of the same type
the answer to this
_SOS_ what exactly is
no it 's the
that _eqn_ corresponds to
_eqn_ one obtains _eqn_
you know what 's
always money in the
described in section _EOS_
_SOS_ and then he
_SOS_ it is seen
near horizon limit of
never gets old _EOS_
_SOS_ that and the
asymptotic form of the
_SOS_ i never understood
other values of _eqn_
'd love to hear
summary and discussion _EOS_
_SOS_ i thought she
of type iib supergravity
on _eqn_ by _eqn_
wanted to make sure
thanks for the recommendation
we define _eqn_ and
_SOS_ the extension to
be sure to check
'll take a look
_SOS_ he should have
goes as follows _EOS_
limit of the _eqn_
that did n't work
'm so sorry _EOS_
used in _cite_ to
_SOS_ in section _eqn_
you 'd like _EOS_
but i 'll take
different from that of
_SOS_ in this situation
i have a lot
_SOS_ _eqn_ in the
you can n't make
_SOS_ do n't go
function of _eqn_ for
but i will n't
the square root of
_SOS_ the behaviour of
you did n't read
_SOS_ indeed in the
know what they 're
_eqn_ and at _eqn_
maybe it 's the
do n't really want
to be well defined
_SOS_ more of a
the decay of the
_SOS_ i see i
the operator _eqn_ has
did not know this
for example in _cite_
i was really hoping
we have found the
is obtained by the
what it 's like
_SOS_ in our approach
_SOS_ so i can
_SOS_ that 's too
effective action can be
low energy limit _EOS_
so i 've been
_SOS_ it was also
thanks for pointing it
_SOS_ i fucking hate
should note that the
for reminding me _EOS_
the phase of the
_SOS_ for the love
calculated in _cite_ _EOS_
is given as _eqn_
on its own _EOS_
_SOS_ this is where
is a total derivative
if you 're the
since there are no
by _eqn_ i e
to be of service
_eqn_ we get a
can n't believe this
sad but true _EOS_
since _eqn_ we have
then _eqn_ and the
this should be the
happens all the time
the quantum numbers of
solution _eqn_ where _eqn_
_SOS_ but of course
by equation _cite_ _EOS_
_eqn_ in _ix_ _EOS_
can n't be the
is also interesting to
think you missed the
_SOS_ but there is
you have a seat
are you fucking kidding
as _eqn_ goes to
gives rise to an
none of them are
know why but i
the higgs field _eqn_
i had to scroll
we take into account
calabi yau three fold
on the east coast
d _eqn_ _eqn_ _EOS_
it seems to me
_eqn_ it is convenient
you know that 's
is why i do
this way we can
had one of those
is _eqn_ in the
_SOS_ here 's an
of the classical action
_SOS_ not sure how
_SOS_ then the action
does it have to
the last term of
_eqn_ in the bulk
i love this _EOS_
does not vanish _EOS_
few weeks ago _EOS_
_SOS_ if i ever
_SOS_ the answer is
're not alone _EOS_
_cite_ and _cite_ imply
thank you for reminding
theory of quantum gravity
's good enough for
be represented as a
_SOS_ but it does
_eqn_ where _eqn_ means
_SOS_ you rang _EOS_
on one of the
of d _eqn_ branes
one way to find
_eqn_ instead of the
for no reason _EOS_
i thought it looked
series in _eqn_ _EOS_
like this one __url__
and show that the
can n't get it
_SOS_ however the _eqn_
_SOS_ oh yeah _EOS_
i think i like
paper we have studied
makes sense to me
type i string theory
_SOS_ the introduction of
give a fuck about
i will look into
is discussed in section
_SOS_ finally it is
you meant to say
_eqn_ can be constructed
that a lot of
dimension of _eqn_ is
no need to get
i 'm in my
of the weyl tensor
_SOS_ haha you 're
yields _eqn_ where _eqn_
i like this _EOS_
is natural to expect
_SOS_ the fuck _EOS_
the results of section
terms of _eqn_ as
you thank you thank
it should have been
understood as follows _EOS_
_SOS_ i forgot about
the coefficients of _eqn_
get one of those
physical point of view
is even better _EOS_
the r le of
_eqn_ and _eqn_ fixed
think you 'll find
a _eqn_ gauge field
need to get out
_SOS_ in addition one
i read the title
_eqn_ is associated with
i guess you can
_SOS_ however _eqn_ is
but they are n't
_SOS_ the non trivial
i will try to
_eqn_ we have _cite_
i laughed out loud
but what if you
the width of the
thats what i thought
the singularities of the
_SOS_ the condition _cite_
the offer though _EOS_
as we can see
it 's up to
_SOS_ how 's the
main result of this
_SOS_ i would rather
momenta _eqn_ and _eqn_
_SOS_ i think everyone
no no no _EOS_
of the symmetry group
need to find a
of the above equation
if you 're still
is defined in terms
_SOS_ it appears that
been looking for a
_SOS_ this is quite
a lot of us
does that mean you
like to thank m
_SOS_ i find your
to work with the
in front of me
the free energy _eqn_
_SOS_ that should be
_eqn_ it follows from
of the kinetic term
so much for the
'm not entirely sure
to the _eqn_ term
_eqn_ can now be
as a whole _EOS_
in momentum space _EOS_
to say exactly this
for simplicity let us
i would n't go
_SOS_ really i 've
we now discuss the
that he does n't
the solution is _eqn_
if _eqn_ or _eqn_
yeah i think i
_SOS_ the coordinate _eqn_
n't agree with you
fourier transform of _eqn_
well are n't you
_SOS_ just like the
from _eqn_ to the
_SOS_ _cite_ eq _EOS_
if you 've got
_SOS_ following ref _EOS_
that 's racist _EOS_
ads _eqn_ s _eqn_
to ask the same
i 'll be able
the poles of the
in terms of its
why do n't they
given by _eqn_ here
thanks so much for
at the origin and
more than that _EOS_
_SOS_ in analogy with
is probably the most
do n't know anything
the _eqn_ action on
_SOS_ indeed let us
she does n't have
are you using _EOS_
side of _cite_ _EOS_
did n't make the
internal degrees of freedom
center for theoretical physics
of the united states
function _eqn_ is given
oh my god you
_eqn_ for small _eqn_
well if you 're
_SOS_ in this talk
does that even mean
_SOS_ also if you
with _eqn_ can be
_SOS_ wait i thought
which can be used
_SOS_ if this was
and _eqn_ as in
two and a half
us assume that _eqn_
all the time but
the metric _cite_ is
can be checked that
guess i 'll have
_SOS_ i highly doubt
_SOS_ the product of
_SOS_ what would be
_SOS_ this was done
why would you do
be some kind of
we have presented a
let 's do this
which means that _eqn_
be presented in the
here i was thinking
_SOS_ can n't argue
_eqn_ denotes the _eqn_
_SOS_ here the _eqn_
any of the other
i dont know why
of the born infeld
'm not a fan
the situation is different
's what i did
dynamical degrees of freedom
_SOS_ thus we will
this was going to
_SOS_ in the us
the action _eqn_ where
_SOS_ introduction sec intro
why are n't you
introduction sec intro _EOS_
oh the irony _EOS_
our discussion of the
that 's because the
_SOS_ not yet _EOS_
to account for the
can be computed by
i was thinking this
but you 're not
correspond to the _eqn_
_SOS_ i disagree _EOS_
are arbitrary constants _EOS_
expressed as _eqn_ _EOS_
that 's right i
like this one _EOS_
with those of the
i can n't upvote
the symmetry group of
in particular that the
looks like it was
_SOS_ the only reason
and _eqn_ which is
_SOS_ as a simple
you in the face
_SOS_ i can never
_SOS_ so _eqn_ is
in particular _eqn_ is
say we all _EOS_
_SOS_ when _eqn_ and
shit like this _EOS_
it is _eqn_ _EOS_
_cite_ _eqn_ _cite_ _EOS_
i realized it was
if we do n't
v e v _EOS_
_SOS_ seriously it 's
the propagator of the
you get it _EOS_
the coupling constants _eqn_
this has to be
_SOS_ i can vouch
_eqn_ is real _EOS_
on the brane at
_SOS_ haha me too
by _eqn_ _cite_ _EOS_
at strong coupling _EOS_
why can n't you
_SOS_ well in that
of a _eqn_ dimensional
_SOS_ for a review
_SOS_ it made me
here have an upvote
in the ground state
to _eqn_ by the
you can see it
_SOS_ let 's go
part by doe grant
of the orbifold _EOS_
one of the more
_SOS_ as usual we
sounds like a plan
_SOS_ the first time
to the open string
_SOS_ note that a
every single time _EOS_
of some of the
you 've got it
_SOS_ did n't they
are known to be
good luck with the
the direct sum of
difficult to show that
i was hoping that
the covariant derivative of
the trick is to
_SOS_ the thing is
the integrals of motion
_SOS_ it is defined
_SOS_ thanks this is
right hand sides of
to look at it
_eqn_ is _eqn_ with
ha ha ha _EOS_
any other way _EOS_
be _eqn_ and _eqn_
in the type i
it does n't get
for both _eqn_ and
for the longest time
with _eqn_ being a
you 're missing the
did n't like the
have the same form
can vouch for this
subgroup _eqn_ of _eqn_
_SOS_ just trying to
on _eqn_ which is
never thought i 'd
of _cite_ for the
_SOS_ calculation of the
you will n't get
leads to the same
thanks for the idea
_SOS_ as _eqn_ the
thank you for being
_SOS_ he was the
_cite_e _eqn_ is the
form _eqn_ in the
going to get a
_SOS_ in accordance with
on to something _EOS_
happens to the best
like to point out
_SOS_ for instance for
you have a source
on the subject _EOS_
the product of _eqn_
be found in appendix
so it 's all
and it will be
the work of _cite_
_SOS_ yeah well i
relations _eqn_ where _eqn_
_SOS_ from the definition
it 's probably not
is the four dimensional
the most part _EOS_
_SOS_ best of luck
_eqn_ is a free
the most general form
this reminds me of
first step is to
should n't you be
_cite_ it can be
i can n't figure
this is analogous to
this is the worst
in light cone gauge
sorry i could n't
a few years _EOS_
_SOS_ the elements of
mean it 's not
and there is a
it 's ok _EOS_
thanks a bunch _EOS_
the _eqn_ direction is
in _cite_ and in
you 're right the
it 's because you
operator _eqn_ is the
_SOS_ watch out for
we hope to report
i know i would
the dirac equation _EOS_
_SOS_ we are not
_SOS_ yeah but if
and thanks for the
from the very beginning
of the gravitational field
she 's going to
's hard to tell
of course this is
it 's just so
on the mass shell
and it would be
will concentrate on the
nothing to worry about
to _eqn_ in _eqn_
a year or two
the range of the
_SOS_ sure why not
for the _eqn_ field
is fucking awesome _EOS_
it does not depend
_SOS_ _eqn_ denotes the
know i did n't
it was n't that
the following section we
at one loop level
the name of that
is natural to ask
that 's not it
_SOS_ the solution _cite_
_SOS_ yeah i figured
do you want _EOS_
of _eqn_ only _EOS_
_SOS_ came to post
part of the metric
derivatives of _eqn_ _EOS_
you 've never had
_SOS_ he 's saying
is of the same
we have calculated the
_SOS_ keep in mind
can be identified as
in accord with the
not supposed to be
're very welcome _EOS_
on the light cone
the total energy of
there are dozens of
_SOS_ be sure to
_SOS_ the main difference
do n't really see
the variables _eqn_ _EOS_
can say that the
over my head _EOS_
_SOS_ can someone explain
the main purpose of
of _eqn_ correspond to
that would be an
_SOS_ the condition that
right here __url__ _EOS_
if we choose the
me and i 'll
in this case as
listen to this guy
can be constructed from
what he 's saying
_eqn_ can be rewritten
i was on the
first term in eq
read that in the
i love you for
of the quantum theory
have some sort of
the bethe salpeter equation
_eqn_ we conclude that
can think of is
i believe you are
the context of a
_SOS_ then why did
_cite_ with _eqn_ _eqn_
a novelty account _EOS_
the yang baxter equation
in _eqn_ with _eqn_
just wanted to say
_SOS_ of course _eqn_
cool thanks for the
is linear in _eqn_
pretty sure it is
i go to the
the classical and quantum
for the general case
so you 're a
_eqn_ to zero _EOS_
like it could be
will be convenient to
would be amazing _EOS_
for each value of
you 're making me
i saw this _EOS_
of the schr dinger
_eqn_ which correspond to
do you know where
like a bitch _EOS_
to higher dimensions _EOS_
_eqn_ is represented by
i might be able
i can get behind
in the yang mills
's not the only
in our case _EOS_
_eqn_ with _eqn_ which
did n't seem to
that at all _EOS_
to the case when
where we use the
of the degrees of
true but it 's
you shut your whore
an _eqn_ gauge theory
to be a lot
energy of the system
more likely to be
i 've found that
is always possible to
see that there are
thanks i do n't
_SOS_ also relevant __url__
is a _eqn_ dimensional
_eqn_ under _eqn_ _EOS_
just pointing out that
at me bro _EOS_
line of eq _EOS_
higher order in _eqn_
to take care of
_SOS_ you called _EOS_
the action _cite_ with
review see _cite_ _EOS_
noncommutative yang mills theory
some of the most
_SOS_ mbox _eqn_ _eqn_
it was a bit
the weak coupling regime
what you think _EOS_
_SOS_ i 'd probably
do not have any
_SOS_ no its not
of the coupling constants
coefficient of _eqn_ in
thanks for the laugh
i 'm curious as
solutions of the form
_SOS_ so is the
spinors _eqn_ and _eqn_
there are two ways
there is nothing wrong
_cite_ there is a
is nothing wrong with
can only hope _EOS_
in the coupling constant
_SOS_ the map _eqn_
the start of the
_SOS_ if he does
are given in section
_SOS_ the theory of
did n't say i
black hole solutions in
mean you do n't
_SOS_ i plan on
_eqn_ to obtain the
the boundary conditions at
thought the exact same
broken down to _eqn_
that kind of thing
_SOS_ and you know
_SOS_ scriptstyle p _eqn_
i 'm a straight
the metric of _eqn_
at the critical point
what you are saying
_SOS_ hey me too
is broken down to
i thought you said
next let us consider
for the reply _EOS_
in the partition function
of _eqn_ should be
to live in a
a couple weeks ago
in the adjoint of
in subsection _cite_ _EOS_
that is an awesome
_SOS_ however we do
i think i found
be understood as follows
i knew someone would
please let me know
we find that _EOS_
_eqn_ appears in the
so i have no
_SOS_ i seem to
is a well known
_SOS_ with _eqn_ being
n't have anything to
day of the week
type iia theory _EOS_
be of service _EOS_
into account that the
_SOS_ if you mean
the form _eqn_ _eqn_
that _eqn_ is _eqn_
unless you want to
holy shit that 's
sake of simplicity we
satisfy _eqn_ and _eqn_
you 'll be able
how did i miss
is depicted in figure
by the introduction of
i want to say
_SOS_ an upvote for
_SOS_ the algebra _eqn_
is represented by a
yeah i 'm sure
of the _eqn_ is
so hard at this
i read this _EOS_
one can prove that
_SOS_ not yet but
of the second order
i 'm saying that
the gauge fields are
_eqn_ coming from the
rest of my life
_SOS_ he must be
_SOS_ this is analogous
'm not mistaken _EOS_
on both sides of
note that we can
would be nice if
in a few weeks
of the self energy
_SOS_ cal a _eqn_
as it 's not
_eqn_ which is an
i 'm fairly sure
in other words there
in the military _EOS_
not sure what the
the norm of the
tell me more _EOS_
to _eqn_ where the
_SOS_ no just a
the last few years
_SOS_ i 'm kind
of the m5 brane
in that picture _EOS_
the same as _eqn_
_SOS_ woah woah woah
order to compute the
_SOS_ therefore we conclude
when it 's a
it has to do
was considered in _cite_
laughed my ass off
section we will consider
_SOS_ they satisfy the
how to do it
_eqn_ or _eqn_ _eqn_
n't have to pay
_SOS_ you would have
will assume that _eqn_
in the standard way
n't mean to be
_SOS_ give me a
_cite_ _eqn_ where we
_SOS_ this result can
to try it _EOS_
_SOS_ i just looked
depending on _eqn_ _EOS_
do n't look at
spontaneous symmetry breaking _EOS_
the magnetic field is
to try it out
_SOS_ i knew someone
the gauge theory is
the notion of a
why do n't we
_SOS_ they look like
of type iib on
find _eqn_ and _eqn_
you do n't do
_SOS_ the coefficients of
to make sure i
be part of the
in conclusion we have
been a long time
dimensional yang mills theory
we have found a
why would n't you
__url__ you go _EOS_
the author is grateful
one obtains _eqn_ _EOS_
think i need to
_SOS_ we shall discuss
gave you an upvote
_SOS_ holy fuck i
_eqn_ which is equivalent
only way to be
rest of this section
_SOS_ it has to
we have to choose
_SOS_ you should do
the equation _eqn_ where
_SOS_ my point is
we find that there
_eqn_ as it should
but i can see
argument is invalid _EOS_
the one in _cite_
can be deduced from
i think i could
and we do not
he said it was
conformal invariance of the
that would be so
i clicked the link
on the torus _EOS_
_eqn_ but _eqn_ _EOS_
say that it 's
the transverse space _EOS_
this made me lol
a subgroup of the
exactly the same _EOS_
_SOS_ read that as
_eqn_ which is in
_SOS_ i made this
in order to keep
n't know what they
the sense that it
beat me to the
there is a one
check it out __url__
the string scale _eqn_
_SOS_ yes of course
_eqn_ up to the
_SOS_ let us then
was what i was
it out thanks _EOS_
of black holes _EOS_
_SOS_ in general this
i did n't actually
he was in the
we have to solve
just wanted to make
the essence of the
at least once a
the number of particles
how dare you _EOS_
is not gauge invariant
and _cite_ for the
to look at _EOS_
if they want to
in _cite_ with the
'm the only one
then _eqn_ is the
i have to ask
the auxiliary fields _eqn_
's no way to
_SOS_ introduction and summary
_SOS_ to see that
thanks very much _EOS_
in this case i
is beyond the scope
_SOS_ in general it
you might be right
_eqn_ one gets _eqn_
was going to go
's a difference _EOS_
of _cite_ and the
_SOS_ fuck yes _EOS_
the state _eqn_ is
comment in this thread
we can identify the
i 've been a
of the einstein equations
pm me your address
take the form _EOS_
be of interest to
you made me laugh
have a well defined
that 's just how
_SOS_ seems like a
is interpreted as a
representation of the algebra
to be the one
i 'm missing something
periodic boundary conditions _EOS_
_SOS_ he 's actually
_SOS_ the integral over
'll be in the
_SOS_ the issue of
_SOS_ we also assume
great minds think alike
we return to the
side of the road
which are related to
_SOS_ we will start
then you have to
the orbifold _eqn_ _EOS_
what you want to
a little more than
as for the _eqn_
from _cite_ we have
that 's good _EOS_
_eqn_ is a holomorphic
in front of you
d _eqn_ d _eqn_
next time i 'm
be determined from the
the worst part is
needed in order to
that is the best
is obtained by taking
to you good sir
_SOS_ that did n't
_SOS_ they are _eqn_
of the hamiltonian _eqn_
works like a charm
_SOS_ so say we
turns out that _eqn_
if it were a
of the second term
_SOS_ scriptstyle p p
could n't figure out
scriptstyle p p _EOS_
that guy is a
and _eqn_ are determined
you keep using that
sure it was n't
to the field equations
'm sure there 's
institute for theoretical physics
_SOS_ i will do
metric _eqn_ where _eqn_
_SOS_ the vector _eqn_
only one who thought
_SOS_ that is pretty
_SOS_ the light cone
and similarly for the
that 's funny i
can n't be serious
we have argued that
and _eqn_ are independent
made a huge mistake
is directly related to
it will be a
_SOS_ for the moment
to make up for
now i have a
the solution is given
're supposed to be
_eqn_ in powers of
_SOS_ can n't believe
for _eqn_ the solution
_SOS_ you 've obviously
function _eqn_ of the
_eqn_ is the one
i had n't heard
_SOS_ it 's how
given by equation _cite_
the canonical commutation relations
you know he 's
the present case the
you 're saying _EOS_
case where _eqn_ _EOS_
i can n't take
_SOS_ i wonder why
there is a single
_eqn_ is the sum
i doubt it _EOS_
is defined in the
to be at the
of the _eqn_ operator
the second one _EOS_
_SOS_ the trick is
where the function _eqn_
_SOS_ never a miscommunication
_eqn_ of _eqn_ with
depends on where you
the massless spectrum of
there it is _EOS_
for a discussion of
n't know where you
it was more like
the brane in the
i never knew that
the fact that a
for fuck 's sake
the massless thirring model
_eqn_ is one of
it i can n't
and _eqn_ may be
_SOS_ this can also
thank you it was
formulation of the theory
to fix it _EOS_
_SOS_ first we have
_SOS_ is n't there
_cite_ we have _EOS_
i figured it out
_SOS_ i think of
_SOS_ later we will
_SOS_ what about this
may be written in
n't going to be
symmetry of the _eqn_
_SOS_ beta _eqn_ _EOS_
that 's when you
_SOS_ would have been
as explained in section
_SOS_ this needs more
us consider the following
_SOS_ since _eqn_ has
_SOS_ too bad you
're going to get
a singularity at _eqn_
_SOS_ i always get
_SOS_ thus for the
does that mean i
space of _eqn_ _EOS_
just to make sure
of the group _EOS_
_eqn_ to _eqn_ in
it would be cool
i did n't i
pure yang mills theory
is given by s
this video __url__ _EOS_
_SOS_ the theory has
not sure how to
as follows from eq
yes yes i am
_cite_ as follows _EOS_
every fucking time _EOS_
_SOS_ from _cite_ one
not a big fan
_SOS_ was that a
the most general solution
is reflected in the
what did you expect
of mass _eqn_ _EOS_
to be done _EOS_
_eqn_ follows from the
i work in a
of the action for
so i can get
have a bunch of
this completes the proof
for the zero modes
it 's still not
in these cases the
think i love you
_SOS_ which is a
of the first term
_SOS_ it 's obviously
in the last step
complex _eqn_ plane _EOS_
winter is coming _EOS_
is the only reason
section we construct the
_SOS_ this yields the
full of shit _EOS_
i am the _EOS_
the wilson loop _EOS_
_SOS_ the only one
do you know of
only one of the
for the _eqn_ gauge
me too it 's
now that 's just
the action is given
_eqn_ and _eqn_ models
to make sure you
or do you just
to the action _EOS_
_SOS_ we suppose that
i could do that
_SOS_ there 's still
an effective field theory
_SOS_ then we will
oh i thought you
felt the same way
fields are given by
_SOS_ by the same
in the kitchen _EOS_
be replaced by the
you have to say
_SOS_ i just noticed
now that we have
_SOS_ assuming that the
i hope you enjoy
_SOS_ this looks like
is the subject of
'm glad i was
constraints _eqn_ and _eqn_
a few of the
the hamiltonian _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ oh i get
of the extrinsic curvature
_SOS_ _cite_ it follows
do n't take kindly
for the offer _EOS_
is easy to find
do n't we all
for the two point
_SOS_ we shall call
it i did n't
_SOS_ listen to this
the differential equation _cite_
it but i do
we suppose that the
_SOS_ it 's _EOS_
the _eqn_ theory with
_SOS_ u mad _EOS_
details see _cite_ _EOS_
that 's an awesome
to do is to
did a great job
does not contain any
'm too lazy to
the world volume _EOS_
_SOS_ the first thing
with _eqn_ which is
_SOS_ you would think
order in _eqn_ we
as it has been
it 's a new
n't think so i
the constant _eqn_ _EOS_
is the best i
suggested in _cite_ _EOS_
are shown in figure
n't go wrong with
i 'll keep that
identical to that of
it 's not exactly
the second equation in
out the window _EOS_
that _eqn_ is also
we obtain that _eqn_
through try once more
we are in a
_SOS_ worth it _EOS_
we have seen the
_SOS_ also it 's
fields _eqn_ _eqn_ _eqn_
_eqn_ where we use
i believe you 're
like a year old
only _eqn_ and _eqn_
it 's been done
research was supported in
have used _eqn_ _EOS_
you have n't already
in the target space
you should try it
_SOS_ no shit _EOS_
_eqn_ which we will
a _eqn_ gauge theory
do n't get any
_SOS_ we will work
in the middle east
_SOS_ the joke is
for instance _cite_ _EOS_
_SOS_ moreover in the
than i thought _EOS_
_SOS_ what was that
this section we give
_SOS_ as a final
_SOS_ sure i 'll
it 's basically a
of _eqn_ over _eqn_
_SOS_ i know he
a total derivative _EOS_
i might as well
restriction of _eqn_ to
_SOS_ in the commutative
when was the last
here 's __url__ a
of the spin connection
i agree with your
which gives rise to
_SOS_ we compute the
in the last years
'm going to assume
is referred to as
name is robert paulson
only a finite number
in my eyes _EOS_
we then have _eqn_
_SOS_ i got that
the case in the
_SOS_ you can make
of the six dimensional
i have not seen
show that in the
_SOS_ no that is
are set to zero
long as _eqn_ _EOS_
or if you 're
_eqn_ in equation _cite_
was going on _EOS_
it does n't take
we will only consider
_SOS_ _cite_ we show
have to look into
even if you 're
the second part of
_SOS_ trust me i
can be determined from
_SOS_ they 're also
we also need to
the manifold _eqn_ _EOS_
you will n't regret
is this __url__ _EOS_
one arrives at the
to see here _EOS_
but i guess that
play a crucial role
it 's like he
the situation is more
_SOS_ yes he is
using the definition of
have to consider the
if you had a
_SOS_ thanks i really
we want to find
taken into account in
think it 'd be
_SOS_ glad to be
's kind of like
_SOS_ in principle one
_SOS_ are you me
to solve the equations
are such that _eqn_
give you an upvote
they are related to
they do n't do
_SOS_ why would he
in order to show
is given in eq
letting me know _EOS_
_SOS_ damn you _EOS_
and _eqn_ for all
in the so called
n't believe i did
_SOS_ i bought it
_eqn_ goes to infinity
is the origin of
took the time to
and see what happens
the boundaries of the
_SOS_ glad to help
the grand canonical ensemble
like some sort of
to _eqn_ by _eqn_
_SOS_ that is just
on _eqn_ such that
of the matrices _eqn_
think you 're thinking
is supported by a
say the exact same
coordinates _eqn_ where _eqn_
people just do n't
equations of motion can
what 's it like
let us analyze the
time of year _EOS_
a product of two
that 's my favorite
be obtained in the
i 'm doing it
_SOS_ i wish this
the existence of this
_SOS_ the notion of
i 'm moving to
like i said i
values of the coupling
with a negative cosmological
you do know that
_SOS_ it is assumed
you 've got the
_SOS_ yeah he was
_eqn_ gauge field _eqn_
_SOS_ that was awesome
can be derived by
no no it 's
with periodic boundary conditions
_eqn_ which is also
you can n't afford
from the form of
money in the banana
_SOS_ i second the
we can choose the
in fact in the
to me all the
the end of that
use of eq _EOS_
_SOS_ we can rewrite
that 's the whole
_SOS_ you never know
flat space time _EOS_
the equation _cite_ is
where i come from
but i am not
used in ref _EOS_
in the phase space
think it should be
the organizers of the
you do n't actually
does not contain the
me i 'm a
_SOS_ since when is
and three point functions
_SOS_ as was shown
of those things _EOS_
_SOS_ i could see
of the type ii
for quite a while
in type iib string
_SOS_ how do we
that the metric is
in the thread _EOS_
the computation of _eqn_
_SOS_ it 's usually
_SOS_ label _eqn_ _EOS_
square root of the
the life of me
_SOS_ now that we
thinking more along the
best thing i 've
complex structure of the
it does n't exist
the motion of a
_SOS_ most of them
anti de sitter spacetime
i usually do n't
order in _eqn_ and
's talking about _EOS_
of the fixed point
a multiple of _eqn_
beat the shit out
's super effective _EOS_
so we have to
it thanks for the
on the domain wall
_eqn_ the second term
the back of a
_SOS_ as we saw
_SOS_ you should watch
be seen as follows
on the west coast
is there any other
the properties of _eqn_
_SOS_ it is based
it in the first
'm glad you like
is the purpose of
a wide class of
had no idea it
so much fun _EOS_
_SOS_ i had this
are discussed in section
_SOS_ i see the
to note that _eqn_
does not compute _EOS_
to notice that the
conclude that _eqn_ _EOS_
you 're willing to
_eqn_ and the metric
yeah that 's a
n't know there was
of the complex structure
quantum numbers of the
what was it _EOS_
's more like a
limits _eqn_ and _eqn_
has anything to do
we show how to
_SOS_ some of them
the near future _EOS_
and _eqn_ _eqn_ is
yep that 's the
if _eqn_ we have
one on the left
despite the fact that
would be a lot
are dealing with a
i thought that too
_SOS_ they 're called
on the _eqn_ dimensional
_SOS_ the concept of
to be a little
i do n't but
in section we briefly
i was just making
is the same _EOS_
_SOS_ we give a
meant to be a
i 'm saying _EOS_
to _eqn_ can be
_SOS_ i work for
_eqn_ d _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ it 's supposed
is the analogue of
had never heard of
we observe that _eqn_
i can only assume
radius _eqn_ of the
i think of it
the lorentz group _EOS_
as defined in _cite_
i want to upvote
_SOS_ you will be
tells us that _eqn_
_SOS_ i 'm totally
in summary we have
_SOS_ to summarize we
i want to hear
of functions on the
the banana stand _EOS_
_SOS_ i just came
the vev of the
i 'm really not
is defined on the
i highly recommend it
in the above we
_SOS_ in what way
the dirac born infeld
oh i get it
quantum field theory and
this leads us to
you can say that
_SOS_ it 's as
_SOS_ we will present
_SOS_ we conjecture that
i guess i could
_cite_ becomes _eqn_ _EOS_
and over and over
of the d branes
how do i do
the line bundle _eqn_
sets _eqn_ and _eqn_
so that i can
_eqn_ supersymmetric gauge theory
this is a joke
i 've never met
up to now we
_SOS_ we can obtain
spoken like a true
the representation _eqn_ of
you can find a
_SOS_ sorry it 's
_eqn_ can not be
i am not the
into _eqn_ and _eqn_
of the four point
on your wedding day
_SOS_ _eqn_ with _eqn_
_SOS_ pretty sure he
_SOS_ we find a
n't think i 'm
n't look like a
the modified bessel function
and _cite_ into _cite_
forgot to mention that
_SOS_ i 'm i
the important point is
_eqn_ and _eqn_ give
i dont know what
n't even know that
was obtained in _cite_
_eqn_ is a closed
i 'm wrong _EOS_
_SOS_ awesome i 'll
obtained by taking the
_SOS_ i suppose it
be understood as the
trying to be funny
we can perform the
the same thing with
to the yang mills
_SOS_ the standard model
_SOS_ the worst part
_SOS_ you could n't
given in fig _EOS_
_SOS_ i got this
_eqn_ the situation is
of the _eqn_ fields
thank you i am
_eqn_ is a dimensionless
you trying to say
_SOS_ if you live
the dynamics of a
by the number of
i can n't watch
_cite_ we review the
sure that 's a
no it was a
the _eqn_ function is
_SOS_ recently there has
all over the world
i went to school
that the functions _eqn_
_eqn_ transforms as _eqn_
sure why you 're
_SOS_ now it 's
this point it is
i sure as hell
we have not been
i have ever heard
not been able to
_SOS_ he 's like
of the spectrum _EOS_
_eqn_ is a smooth
it 's a fucking
's the only reason
where in the last
_SOS_ in this theory
do n't say that
_SOS_ we need more
of _cite_ is _eqn_
more often than not
the question of whether
is n't really a
the previous sections we
_SOS_ acknowledgment acknowledgment unnumbered
should n't have to
acknowledgment acknowledgment unnumbered _EOS_
this have to do
_SOS_ i support this
plotted in fig _EOS_
_SOS_ the solutions are
the rest of reddit
of the theory _cite_
to the left _EOS_
really i do n't
that the second term
metric of the form
to be confused with
goes to infinity _EOS_
that 's how the
_SOS_ do tell _EOS_
limit in which the
_SOS_ my point exactly
the degeneracy of the
_SOS_ nah he 's
makes more sense _EOS_
the positive tension brane
_SOS_ well yes but
_eqn_ is the complex
_SOS_ i have always
the transformation _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ would n't be
_eqn_ is the vector
on the horizon _EOS_
that must have been
approve this message _EOS_
with _eqn_ we have
a couple of months
gauge fields _eqn_ and
_SOS_ the coordinates _eqn_
n't take kindly to
given by s _EOS_
yes yes yes _EOS_
_SOS_ you just have
in order to cancel
the initial and final
what does this mean
than i do _EOS_
we can find a
argued in _cite_ that
_SOS_ it 's fucking
_eqn_ is the induced
_SOS_ i could not
one can think of
_SOS_ of particular interest
it 's got a
i 'm guessing they
the wilson loop in
_eqn_ is odd _EOS_
do n't use the
i thought there was
let us take _eqn_
_SOS_ or is it
means that we have
'll do it _EOS_
author is grateful to
it was a lot
of _eqn_ has been
direct consequence of the
i believe that is
the zero modes _EOS_
with a bit of
_eqn_ where in the
something i do n't
carry on then _EOS_
green s function _EOS_
i 've seen him
solution to the equations
i feel like we
the solution can be
due to the existence
you my good sir
as a power series
have a feeling that
in the three dimensional
some reason i thought
_SOS_ oh of course
space _eqn_ where _eqn_
a chern simons term
like to see the
at finite _eqn_ _EOS_
i was at the
an explicit expression for
works fine for me
__url__ as well _EOS_
of the effective theory
_SOS_ does n't seem
this work we have
for a bit _EOS_
of the quantum field
and _eqn_ are of
the time it 's
and _cite_ for _eqn_
you that 's why
get the reference _EOS_
of the fields in
_SOS_ no but they
structure on _eqn_ _EOS_
for _eqn_ one can
i thought about it
_SOS_ i found that
of the tachyon potential
has been shown to
this comment made me
brane world volume _EOS_
so that 's how
_SOS_ oh god what
arbitrary function of _eqn_
_SOS_ finally we discuss
you would n't want
_SOS_ yeah that would
_eqn_ which satisfy the
has been used to
what it means _EOS_
do n't make the
it is also clear
_SOS_ what if he
in sections _cite_ and
although i do n't
as one of the
form _eqn_ and the
i missed it _EOS_
_SOS_ to get a
can n't do anything
in section we introduce
supposed to be the
does not correspond to
one half of the
seems like a good
_SOS_ then it follows
here __url__ is the
_SOS_ why the downvotes
leads to _eqn_ where
the same way that
whether or not the
_SOS_ you know who
_eqn_ in _eqn_ dimensions
_SOS_ oh i have
the killing vector _eqn_
that i want to
the following commutation relations
_SOS_ eh it 's
_SOS_ the two dimensional
_SOS_ the lagrangian density
because you 're a
_SOS_ and there 's
in _eqn_ dimensions is
of the movie _EOS_
that the gauge group
_SOS_ i 'll make
_SOS_ so that _eqn_
_SOS_ this approach is
no one will ever
_SOS_ yea that 's
comes from the fact
a valid point _EOS_
for the one loop
and i 'm glad
of the same form
denoted as _eqn_ _EOS_
it 's important to
and this is my
similar to the case
can be summarized as
i hope that 's
for the open string
was in high school
post a picture of
representations _eqn_ and _eqn_
've never seen one
that of _cite_ _EOS_
i think it will
in order that the
i thought about that
of the coulomb branch
that was the best
using _eqn_ and _eqn_
_SOS_ in all seriousness
let us try to
can be solved in
fuck are you talking
_SOS_ but that would
the magnetic field _EOS_
_SOS_ similarly for the
haha i did n't
first thing i did
part by the grant
_SOS_ me neither _EOS_
all orders in perturbation
_SOS_ the constants _eqn_
what 's the problem
_SOS_ recall that in
are you looking for
are functions of the
this thread __url__ _EOS_
the two types of
there 's not much
_SOS_ if she 's
value of the coupling
_SOS_ you live in
as shown in ref
because they did n't
energy momentum tensor in
_eqn_ for each _eqn_
is not a good
point functions of the
when you want to
and the other is
my all time favorite
gauge theory on a
that was n't the
can n't it be
the integral in eq
_SOS_ and then there
_SOS_ kappa _eqn_ _EOS_
the _eqn_ brane is
went through try once
_eqn_ p _eqn_ _EOS_
do n't remember the
to the definition of
you are my hero
because of all the
would like to point
_SOS_ i 'm too
_SOS_ the difference is
_SOS_ let 's be
in the _eqn_ th
_cite_ has to be
all of them are
in flat space time
so i 'm going
i just threw up
should be replaced by
the kalb ramond field
was kind of a
really do n't like
that for _eqn_ we
and the function _eqn_
thank you i have
do not have to
i hope you are
as someone who has
in particular the _eqn_
that does n't even
want to show that
able to do that
the closure of the
the field strength is
the same thing in
at _eqn_ _eqn_ and
right in front of
_SOS_ at the level
who said anything about
_ix_ of _cite_ _EOS_
do n't even need
i 'll be right
obtained from the _eqn_
four dimensional cosmological constant
i 'm supposed to
_SOS_ my god i
partition function can be
in _eqn_ dimensions the
of luck to you
to you as well
we hope to return
and _cite_ we see
was worth it _EOS_
action of _eqn_ is
you sure about that
denotes differentiation with respect
seem to have a
_SOS_ i 'll bring
the theory _cite_ _EOS_
_SOS_ the contribution from
i 'm sorry what
_SOS_ fuck everything about
_eqn_ which agrees with
fuck everything about that
operator _eqn_ where _eqn_
an arbitrary constant _EOS_
now i know what
are you sure _EOS_
constraints _cite_ and _cite_
_SOS_ first we will
you have n't heard
_SOS_ fair enough but
_cite_ to the case
fuck you i 'm
in fact we have
makes a lot more
now return to the
_SOS_ could you explain
that in eq _EOS_
_SOS_ pretty sure i
the result is the
_SOS_ he 's on
in section we construct
_SOS_ you 're getting
_eqn_ stands for _eqn_
_SOS_ while i agree
the field equations _cite_
_SOS_ why does this
to the condition _eqn_
i had in mind
the theory has a
do you want a
of the representation _eqn_
eleven dimensional supergravity _EOS_
right out of my
_SOS_ this procedure is
of my mouth _EOS_
be rewritten in terms
i really hope you
i guess i will
the roots of the
changed my life _EOS_
have the form _cite_
refer to _cite_ for
what you just said
thanks i 'll try
the vectors _eqn_ and
pointing it out _EOS_
we also show that
in this gauge the
leave this __url__ here
but it 's pretty
of the vector field
in detail in the
when you 're done
fell in love with
in case of the
_SOS_ _eqn_ are the
put it in a
's the kind of
_eqn_ generated by the
_SOS_ pretty much the
taking into account _cite_
given by _ix_ _EOS_
to be fair you
_SOS_ i use the
general expression for the
four dimensional theory _EOS_
in the untwisted sector
this was one of
_SOS_ if they are
we will not consider
may be able to
the center of _eqn_
can easily show that
get a hold of
a whole new meaning
the quotient space _eqn_
here is that the
kind of like the
and i 'll send
that there are _eqn_
that 's what 's
the result for _eqn_
in order to evaluate
that 'd be a
_SOS_ there are more
also be written as
_SOS_ if we want
be one of those
the signature of the
you fucking kidding me
get back to work
using _cite_ we obtain
might be a bit
_eqn_ is given as
as bad as the
no i 'm pretty
of this model _EOS_
_SOS_ where is that
of _eqn_ where the
find that _eqn_ and
have a word with
by _eqn_ or _eqn_
or the other _EOS_
and _eqn_ depend on
but i think he
_SOS_ it is it
_SOS_ the remaining _eqn_
be set to zero
thanks for the feedback
_SOS_ i would go
_cite_ where the _eqn_
_SOS_ this turns out
i think not _EOS_
is more important than
now let us turn
think it is _EOS_
we have _eqn_ we
_SOS_ the formula _cite_
actually i do n't
the starting point for
you get used to
guess you 're right
notation _eqn_ and _eqn_
_eqn_ to the _eqn_
thank you though _EOS_
_eqn_ transforms as a
pretty sure you 're
i need to watch
of the _eqn_ branes
_SOS_ to evaluate the
just to be sure
fine for me _EOS_
the subject of the
_SOS_ the coefficient of
_SOS_ true dat _EOS_
for as long as
that the low energy
_SOS_ thanks very much
is straightforward to verify
_eqn_ is positive _EOS_
thanks so much i
the brane tension _EOS_
was going to suggest
'm going to make
a review see _cite_
_SOS_ this guy 's
presented in section _EOS_
'm going to get
can write down the
this is done in
yeah i guess i
_SOS_ _cite_ and in
though i 'm not
as _eqn_ or _eqn_
shit out of you
everything went better than
should be emphasized that
_SOS_ and how do
fundamental representation of the
can confirm that this
the d3 brane _EOS_
of course i 'm
the general expression for
_eqn_ acts as a
i sent you a
_SOS_ the gauge invariant
a quick google search
_SOS_ if we denote
lot of people do
_SOS_ sad but true
metric takes the form
do you still have
non commutative gauge theory
form _eqn_ where we
n't come up with
like to see a
mass _eqn_ of the
to zero in the
you did n't like
he does n't like
straightforward to see that
_SOS_ so you would
the field equations are
if i can get
will denote by _eqn_
can be read from
it 's a different
_SOS_ am i missing
given by e _EOS_
_SOS_ as a former
context of string theory
_SOS_ i see that
department of physics _EOS_
also in this case
way to be sure
_SOS_ and then the
_cite_ we have the
can be constructed as
i can n't decide
better drink my own
of the _eqn_ space
my own piss _EOS_
thus _eqn_ is a
a polynomial in _eqn_
we do n't get
_eqn_ s in the
it really is _EOS_
_eqn_ to _eqn_ by
_SOS_ yeah i noticed
the first equation in
know there was a
of _eqn_ is defined
of the btz black
details can be found
see what you 're
is that what you
the _eqn_ components of
_SOS_ he is n't
three point functions of
_SOS_ but but i
the type iia theory
_SOS_ do they have
_eqn_ corresponding to a
_SOS_ according to eq
_SOS_ she is a
be equal to the
seems to be working
and there are no
i like the part
in the effective theory
upvote for making me
have n't you heard
section we introduce the
the absolute value of
they used to be
_SOS_ _cite_ is satisfied
i could n't remember
hard for me to
is simply given by
do not commute with
in the box _EOS_
may be obtained from
no he did n't
of the _eqn_ case
sure what you 're
_SOS_ i will not
the eigenvalue of the
does n't work on
to thank j _EOS_
_SOS_ i know its
that the _eqn_ term
playing the role of
what does that even
_SOS_ just in case
to _eqn_ is _eqn_
_SOS_ neither do i
_eqn_ in the presence
_SOS_ what you do
scalar field _eqn_ is
equal to the number
to go with the
i 'll be honest
the _eqn_ theory in
_SOS_ we present a
do you think this
all glory to the
if there is no
dependent part of the
is this from _EOS_
_SOS_ are you not
_eqn_ and the boundary
that is the only
zero mode of _eqn_
've ever had _EOS_
_eqn_ for _eqn_ are
_SOS_ we also consider
much as i hate
_eqn_ and in particular
a way to get
we will calculate the
it appears to be
we argue that the
_SOS_ do n't say
of the supersymmetry algebra
anomaly induced effective action
keep an eye on
_SOS_ thanks i do
that the action is
_SOS_ well there are
the scale _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ in this region
but he 's not
and _eqn_ respectively and
i 'm old _EOS_
a redefinition of the
going to take a
_SOS_ i was totally
following form _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ we claim that
and i still have
see also _cite_ for
yes they do _EOS_
set _eqn_ where _eqn_
they 're not _EOS_
is that supposed to
of _eqn_ there is
it 's a small
terms proportional to the
_SOS_ i usually do
angular momentum _eqn_ _EOS_
we will discuss in
of _eqn_ given in
you will n't have
order to get a
to see how it
_SOS_ me three _EOS_
negative cosmological constant _EOS_
_SOS_ i told you
_SOS_ to make this
the field content of
why the hell would
_eqn_ is a local
did n't know how
_SOS_ _cite_ the first
i 'm not interested
like where this is
two dimensional distance _eqn_
and he 's a
the first step in
in a few months
the _eqn_ subgroup of
_SOS_ where are the
the ground state _eqn_
_SOS_ thus we expect
have the weirdest boner
_SOS_ _cite_ in order
me feel like i
is sufficient to consider
when i was there
equations of motion we
to say the exact
_SOS_ _cite_ has been
is a good one
_SOS_ the main result
for the confusion _EOS_
section we present a
was hoping it was
_eqn_ is the trace
and it was the
and _eqn_ are in
it for a while
_SOS_ i 'm wondering
the boundary condition _EOS_
i 'm still a
the type iib string
_SOS_ where do i
we have that the
all i 'm saying
value of the energy
basis of _eqn_ _EOS_
just trying to help
about it but i
on the level of
i know i am
is that there are
branes wrapped on _eqn_
i 'm still trying
define _eqn_ to be
to be a joke
_SOS_ hi i 'm
_SOS_ the corresponding _eqn_
be contrasted with the
know the difference between
_SOS_ and of course
coupling constant of the
make up for it
relevant part of the
do n't like that
mass of the black
_SOS_ but there 's
_SOS_ furthermore we have
_SOS_ her name is
given by the sum
_SOS_ some men just
_SOS_ we shall first
_eqn_ with _eqn_ an
some men just want
of functions on _eqn_
popped into my head
_SOS_ hell yes _EOS_
be of order _eqn_
sure if it 's
the form of an
_SOS_ something like this
as _eqn_ so that
is invariant with respect
it was just the
_cite_ tells us that
find it hard to
let us know how
respect to the metric
can be easily generalized
have n't had any
_SOS_ the lagrangian of
i was hoping you
but other than that
the integral of _eqn_
're one of the
_cite_ one can see
_SOS_ it is necessary
you know that _EOS_
that when _eqn_ the
_SOS_ it is found
are n't allowed to
in the morning and
the wess zumino model
i never thought about
in the non compact
_eqn_ in other words
to me as well
sure i do n't
value _eqn_ of the
what i thought it
do the trick _EOS_
is well known in
it 's okay _EOS_
result is that the
and the scalar field
to know how to
_eqn_ using eq _EOS_
i approve this message
for more details see
they want you to
so that it is
you ever seen a
say it was a
the manifold _eqn_ is
_SOS_ well i just
of _eqn_ of the
_eqn_ this can be
what did i just
paper is the following
that was the case
_SOS_ do n't take
_eqn_ action on _eqn_
_SOS_ thats why i
_SOS_ the only non
no i 'm just
this is nothing but
_SOS_ i 'm happy
is expressed as _eqn_
_SOS_ the resulting theory
do n't even get
_SOS_ feels good man
this section we describe
have but one upvote
to the computation of
it 's an old
the fermionic zero modes
_SOS_ read this in
we shall see below
_SOS_ the last section
next thing you know
as functions of the
you do n't use
around the world _EOS_
will lead to a
_SOS_ are there any
in the black hole
_SOS_ i believe in
_eqn_ and also _eqn_
in particular there is
to check that out
by the factor _eqn_
i saw it in
all at once _EOS_
order of perturbation theory
i 'm not surprised
on the phase space
_SOS_ contrary to the
thanks i 'm glad
the treatment of the
you can use it
_eqn_ and _eqn_ satisfying
need to have a
_SOS_ if only _EOS_
the case _eqn_ in
_SOS_ ah thanks for
presented in section _cite_
_SOS_ amp amp i
_cite_ can be expressed
_SOS_ was about to
of _eqn_ eq _EOS_
giving rise to the
i just found it
i felt like i
the total angular momentum
_SOS_ it 's awesome
the quantum theory of
_SOS_ i meant to
seen as follows _EOS_
_SOS_ upvote for being
can be decomposed as
_SOS_ this reminds me
have not been able
had no idea this
transformations _eqn_ and _eqn_
i get that a
the following equation _eqn_
people do n't have
that we have not
_SOS_ i gave you
operator _eqn_ is defined
from the equations of
if you have an
that 's probably the
the kaluza klein modes
_SOS_ it is sufficient
_SOS_ we call it
_SOS_ as already mentioned
n't have a problem
in order to preserve
what i came to
what 's not to
with _eqn_ we obtain
discussed in _cite_ and
you mean this __url__
_cite_ in eq _EOS_
for some reason the
be used as a
kids these days _EOS_
big of a deal
we will need to
_eqn_ _eqn_ so that
of the story _EOS_
oh i know i
the equations for _eqn_
make sure you 're
the coupling constant is
'll take your word
be obtained as a
me you do n't
we will take _eqn_
is depicted in fig
no that 's just
_eqn_ dimensional minkowski space
the hell is that
_SOS_ wait wait wait
obtain _eqn_ and _eqn_
i felt the same
the set _eqn_ is
_SOS_ working on it
we have shown in
if you need to
we are only interested
in high school and
remainder of this paper
_SOS_ oh now i
_eqn_ _eqn_ we have
hyper k hler manifold
to say i 'm
_SOS_ are you still
been shown in _cite_
_SOS_ we will argue
one does not simply
have assumed that the
oh my god it
_SOS_ damn you 're
of _eqn_ _eqn_ where
i love your username
the renormalization group flow
equal to one _EOS_
the kind of thing
_SOS_ we may also
_SOS_ well you have
_SOS_ not if they
_eqn_ is different from
_SOS_ rho _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ what you did
_SOS_ disco ball _EOS_
so we have _eqn_
of the month _EOS_
that _eqn_ is positive
shit i did n't
the third term in
can be realized in
i did n't take
but if you do
of the wess zumino
_SOS_ the tree level
let you know if
_SOS_ are you being
case in which _eqn_
can n't get the
given in appendix a
_SOS_ for instance we
_SOS_ that was just
_SOS_ now you know
this paper we use
do n't look like
we shall see the
the bosonic case _EOS_
think you may have
_SOS_ she has a
of _eqn_ super yang
pretty much what i
we can see from
_SOS_ cool thanks for
be used to construct
_cite_ for _eqn_ we
there used to be
for me when i
is associated with a
gauge symmetry in the
in the back _EOS_
do n't you go
imaginary part of _eqn_
in two steps _EOS_
thing to say _EOS_
in any dimension _EOS_
it 's not going
agree with that _EOS_
of the previous sections
it 's always sunny
it is now straightforward
_SOS_ very nice _EOS_
of _eqn_ branes _EOS_
_SOS_ i heard he
when _eqn_ is small
in the wess zumino
that 's a paddlin
_SOS_ the result _cite_
it may not be
disagree with you _EOS_
have been considered in
_SOS_ go fuck yourself
the function _eqn_ can
_eqn_ which in turn
to put it in
_SOS_ the induced metric
of the season _EOS_
_SOS_ in these coordinates
got it thanks _EOS_
to think of a
and one of the
the dimensionality of the
_SOS_ pretty much this
wrapped on _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ we are thus
n't even make sense
_SOS_ thus the only
does it for me
_SOS_ sounds like an
from the perspective of
in this case _cite_
you think it is
i was planning on
this can be understood
_SOS_ for a generic
please tell me that
a lot of other
and the result is
_SOS_ must have been
the relevant part of
_SOS_ i could be
and _eqn_ one can
be able to use
of the _eqn_ matrices
generated by the _eqn_
year and a half
given by the formula
sure about that _EOS_
's because you 're
the case of one
scalar fields _eqn_ and
the entire time _EOS_
_SOS_ i got to
_ix_ we have _eqn_
i 'm not i
is valid for _eqn_
exactly what i came
gauge group _eqn_ is
's not that hard
_cite_ with _eqn_ replaced
_SOS_ we have constructed
of the night _EOS_
_eqn_ will be a
so there 's that
it looks more like
the iib matrix model
on the internet i
this does not mean
_SOS_ ah i did
makes it possible to
a pun thread _EOS_
of the _eqn_ supersymmetry
i think you were
to the value of
_SOS_ why would anyone
pp wave background _EOS_
_eqn_ corrections to the
understand what you 're
_eqn_ the right hand
but he does n't
in the same place
the gauge transformation of
from the variation of
you have to make
the results of our
took the words right
_SOS_ well when you
was found to be
_SOS_ it really does
it remains to be
_SOS_ nah it was
by the action _eqn_
can be easily obtained
n't that bad _EOS_
_SOS_ this will allow
on the show _EOS_
half of the supersymmetries
the past years _EOS_
_eqn_ together with _eqn_
and there 's a
can be constructed in
do you have an
an arrow to the
we have taken the
_SOS_ might want to
effective potential for the
_eqn_ which gives the
well played sir well
other hand we have
was the point of
_SOS_ you may want
where _eqn_ where _eqn_
have i done _EOS_
two point functions of
however there is no
_eqn_ in the last
i 'm not actually
if it did n't
the inner product of
_SOS_ do you even
_SOS_ for the other
_SOS_ they 're pretty
the vacuum structure of
_eqn_ where the last
that but it 's
_SOS_ so you want
will give rise to
_SOS_ i prefer this
first of all it
dirichlet boundary conditions _EOS_
said i do n't
_eqn_ and _eqn_ components
could n't find a
look like this __url__
the generating functional _eqn_
any value of the
get it now _EOS_
_SOS_ there 's more
_eqn_ and _eqn_ coincide
in the following discussion
who am i kidding
was just thinking that
would like to emphasize
i can tell _EOS_
the structure of a
function _eqn_ which is
n't think i 'll
they have the same
to have a word
_eqn_ gives _eqn_ _EOS_
did you see that
two point functions _EOS_
would you say that
a basis for the
get it right _EOS_
_SOS_ do you get
a contribution to the
_SOS_ this made my
fact that the _eqn_
_SOS_ oh right i
the virasoro algebra _EOS_
_SOS_ yeah but what
only depends on the
_SOS_ i wish that
the covariant derivative is
and thus _eqn_ _EOS_
the nail on the
_SOS_ think of the
_SOS_ thus if we
_SOS_ not gonna lie
as a set of
'm going to guess
_SOS_ we derive the
_SOS_ end array _EOS_
yes they are _EOS_
in the air _EOS_
in the space time
_cite_ we can obtain
of the children _EOS_
that the energy of
you can make a
just look at the
part of the spectrum
i 'm doing this
is essentially the same
_SOS_ therefore there is
there 's not a
to work out the
you know how it
_SOS_ that 's about
_eqn_ _eqn_ of the
_SOS_ this is however
i 'll go with
_SOS_ that was an
this section we construct
i for one welcome
of the klein gordon
_eqn_ _eqn_ respectively _EOS_
not part of the
_eqn_ is the identity
in the corner _EOS_
_SOS_ it was found
so do i _EOS_
's not like the
the singularity of the
fuck it i 'm
order to get the
by a gauge transformation
well i can n't
that 's not an
with mass _eqn_ _EOS_
i just read that
theory on the brane
_SOS_ agreed i 'm
hope to return to
order to study the
that 's quite a
_eqn_ can be viewed
let 's not get
_SOS_ you make a
be a function of
_SOS_ sorry did n't
the super yang mills
_SOS_ om nom nom
_SOS_ we will therefore
states in the _eqn_
that 's the reason
equations of motion which
let you know when
_SOS_ _cite_ together with
do n't get what
_eqn_ and of _eqn_
and i am not
's the first time
_eqn_ is a parameter
an integral over the
it 's at the
_SOS_ i just have
therefore we conclude that
have to say i
the event horizon _EOS_
did n't give a
it is not the
_SOS_ in order that
n't mind if i
as we have shown
love that show _EOS_
are only interested in
to the list _EOS_
_SOS_ can you tell
_SOS_ we also define
counts the number of
that checked out _EOS_
_SOS_ the indices _eqn_
_SOS_ they 've been
_SOS_ the d brane
back and forth _EOS_
i 'll get the
when we consider the
_eqn_ is a two
next to each other
_SOS_ where _eqn_ stands
of some sort _EOS_
_eqn_ is the coupling
_SOS_ of the time
we require that the
_SOS_ i bet the
the coordinate _eqn_ is
agree with you more
the next section the
do n't worry the
terms in _cite_ _EOS_
of it that way
of the generators _eqn_
i love you guys
to be positive _EOS_
it is equivalent to
now i need to
_SOS_ quantum field theory
it 's just me
never thought of it
the locations of the
_SOS_ you obviously have
the hamiltonian _eqn_ is
boundary condition at _eqn_
i sure hope so
_SOS_ i 'm ok
_eqn_ w r t
_SOS_ the one on
is more complicated _EOS_
_SOS_ it consists of
like the part where
_SOS_ summary and discussion
me and my friends
for the best _EOS_
on the worldvolume of
the vector space _eqn_
yeah i was thinking
has _eqn_ where _eqn_
i did not see
_SOS_ well it does
means that the _eqn_
black holes in the
but it was the
_SOS_ the left hand
__url__ is what i
just want to see
turn to the case
_SOS_ no we 're
in a more general
'd love to have
in section _eqn_ we
not sure if they
which follows from the
do you ask _EOS_
with radius _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ in _cite_ and
how do you make
the chern simons theory
you did there i
for all _eqn_ _eqn_
last time i was
has been used in
want to be in
about that one _EOS_
the other hand a
is a two dimensional
it in my head
that _eqn_ for any
the age of _EOS_
i 'm on it
of _eqn_ depends on
_eqn_ the theory is
i think the point
_SOS_ hmm i do
can be computed from
i do not understand
we will use a
expansion in terms of
n't realize it was
luck to you _EOS_
there are at least
_SOS_ oh my _EOS_
the winding number of
could n't resist _EOS_
explained in _cite_ _EOS_
is the best way
represented in the form
it is n't the
the action for a
it would just be
on the contrary the
but at least you
we have already seen
_SOS_ i can assure
completely determined by the
_SOS_ i had one
the _eqn_ orbifold _EOS_
pretty sure you can
read _eqn_ where _eqn_
_SOS_ i forgot to
_eqn_ can be seen
a group of people
it then follows that
_SOS_ when i first
in a higher dimensional
_SOS_ please explain _EOS_
eigenvalues of _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ there are various
like to think of
i doing this right
the notion of the
_SOS_ you get a
obtain _eqn_ where we
as a generalization of
like everyone else _EOS_
's a really good
reader is referred to
that has to be
there are two possibilities
the black hole solutions
to talk about it
_SOS_ i want one
of the map _eqn_
but it 's all
the set of the
i first saw it
to the theory of
and what do you
the scope of the
a review of the
i 've just been
was shown in ref
yeah me too _EOS_
a constant magnetic field
n't really want to
it makes sense _EOS_
the de sitter space
_SOS_ why are n't
in the noncommutative case
the dual gauge theory
you want to make
_SOS_ for the second
_SOS_ this changes everything
components of _eqn_ and
it will be the
_SOS_ if i can
finally we would like
_SOS_ that 's interesting
_eqn_ as _eqn_ we
that reminds me of
the modification of the
as we speak _EOS_
is singular at _eqn_
are defined as follows
people like you _EOS_
_eqn_ in accordance with
even though it 's
type iib superstring theory
you think so _EOS_
_SOS_ needless to say
keep using that word
_eqn_ there are _eqn_
the first one to
like to thank prof
you if you 're
n't stick your dick
the bulk of the
_SOS_ in the third
have no clue what
_SOS_ too bad it
the partition function in
is discussed in _cite_
too bad it 's
_SOS_ only if he
_eqn_ and _eqn_ also
do n't know shit
of _eqn_ one can
had something to do
of type iib string
all over it _EOS_
is to be expected
of the _eqn_ in
the looks of it
i 'm guessing that
these equations can be
_SOS_ haha i 've
gauge fields in the
'm still trying to
the form of _cite_
_ix_ can be written
just as long as
lagrangian is invariant under
that 's an interesting
no this is patrick
us begin with the
a modification of the
this is patrick _EOS_
interested in the case
n't be such a
_SOS_ as we are
_SOS_ not as much
by far my favorite
k hler potential _EOS_
i was n't even
where _eqn_ are _eqn_
_eqn_ hence _eqn_ _EOS_
i was listening to
's nice to see
like to thank j
_SOS_ but they are
the dilaton and the
_cite_ leads to _eqn_
i liked it _EOS_
in the paper _EOS_
men just want to
've made a huge
of the mass term
element _eqn_ of _eqn_
in the car _EOS_
_SOS_ i actually had
operators _eqn_ _eqn_ and
bro bro bro bro
follows from _cite_ and
_SOS_ the _eqn_ field
is strong with this
in the previous paragraph
you 've obviously never
_SOS_ _cite_ _eqn_ the
_SOS_ i tried it
_SOS_ more generally we
_SOS_ or this __url__
note that eq _EOS_
this is going _EOS_
_SOS_ the radius of
to the bottom of
think about that _EOS_
will return to this
_SOS_ i 'd pay
of the manifold _EOS_
it is but i
section we will show
consider the limit _eqn_
not to be confused
_SOS_ finally we can
_SOS_ well i hope
can read off the
i could n't think
_SOS_ he 's talking
gauge group of the
are compatible with the
like some kind of
i think i remember
to the free energy
_eqn_ are arbitrary functions
pretty sure i 'm
'm on my phone
_eqn_ is interpreted as
_SOS_ does n't look
of the phase transition
're not talking about
_SOS_ in the two
_SOS_ nope but i
_cite_ and _cite_ which
_eqn_ invariance of the
this may be the
n't be the first
which turns out to
have to go back
that _eqn_ depends on
_SOS_ thanks for letting
which allows us to
is also easy to
might be a little
i 'm not looking
the expressions _cite_ and
_SOS_ as will be
_SOS_ would n't the
_SOS_ i want the
by the sum of
see this let us
to keep up with
was studied in _cite_
what 's your favorite
it is not obvious
it looks like i
coordinates on _eqn_ _EOS_
from the future _EOS_
did it for me
is worth mentioning that
and over again _EOS_
where we have set
that i am not
then be written as
_eqn_ of _eqn_ are
it any other way
exactly what i said
refer to _cite_ _EOS_
_SOS_ well i know
for the case at
bosons and fermions _EOS_
read this __url__ _EOS_
_SOS_ that was so
to the absence of
_SOS_ for a general
like an idiot _EOS_
by integrating out the
i 'm out _EOS_
_SOS_ in section three
are not alone _EOS_
_SOS_ we construct the
me i 'm not
_SOS_ is that like
of the ricci tensor
n't understand why people
the solution _cite_ is
're right i 'm
_SOS_ as to the
a lot of stuff
we also have _eqn_
_SOS_ when you say
_eqn_ is a matrix
_SOS_ can i ask
the black hole mass
but one upvote to
of the terms in
did n't see this
in the massive case
_SOS_ fuck that shit
solutions to eq _EOS_
_SOS_ did i say
point of view this
_SOS_ we restrict ourselves
people in the world
needs more upvotes _EOS_
there is also an
is a result of
long have you been
_eqn_ we can use
in no time _EOS_
all the time when
that the action _cite_
_SOS_ did n't he
the same way we
paper we will consider
this is dog _EOS_
exact solution of the
to make it look
n't even need to
of general relativity _EOS_
_SOS_ very true i
_SOS_ we have now
i see you 've
the minimum of _eqn_
and ye shall receive
has been considered in
are two different things
values of the _eqn_
_SOS_ you 're awesome
are summarized in table
made my night _EOS_
purpose of this section
's pretty cool _EOS_
progress has been made
exactly the same thing
has been made in
let 's be honest
proportional to _eqn_ which
a native english speaker
string field theory _cite_
a month ago _EOS_
on the d3 branes
_SOS_ oh so you
one finds _eqn_ where
_SOS_ you just blew
is written in terms
heterotic string theory _EOS_
right i do n't
'm guessing it 's
see that for _eqn_
the killing spinor equations
what would happen if
_SOS_ substituting eq _EOS_
yeah i thought it
_eqn_ belongs to _eqn_
i do n't make
i like to call
of the near horizon
_SOS_ we show how
look at all the
back to the future
string coupling constant _EOS_
_SOS_ indeed we have
i figured i 'd
'd never heard of
the chan paton factors
_SOS_ i want that
consider the case that
need to go to
operator _eqn_ is a
for reading the manuscript
__url__ and __url__ _EOS_
_eqn_ is a compact
_SOS_ and i do
_eqn_ where now _eqn_
_SOS_ it 's nice
solution is _eqn_ _EOS_
the derivative expansion _EOS_
what you want _EOS_
i was wondering what
subgroup of the _eqn_
did you get it
in the transverse directions
_SOS_ this leads us
would be awesome if
_SOS_ to summarize the
because you did n't
let us summarize the
like i like my
i like my women
this form of the
_SOS_ this guy _EOS_
_cite_ due to the
_SOS_ actually i was
_eqn_ _eqn_ _eqn_ is
like there 's a
on _eqn_ as _eqn_
's not like he
non vanishing components of
it was a very
the state of the
_SOS_ so you have
in the thermodynamic limit
hey everyone this guy
of _eqn_ in this
_SOS_ finally we would
glad i did n't
_SOS_ then we get
out of that _EOS_
did n't know i
tensors _eqn_ and _eqn_
'm a girl _EOS_
of the string coupling
_SOS_ similarly to the
i guess this is
_SOS_ he has n't
for _eqn_ _eqn_ where
boundary conditions at _eqn_
i 'm also a
_SOS_ alternatively one can
i have n't used
_SOS_ you and i
the standard model of
'll keep that in
polynomial of degree _eqn_
_SOS_ not really the
made use of the
am i going to
for simplicity we shall
_eqn_ is dual to
well it is a
solution is _eqn_ where
sounds like he 's
is straightforward to see
the only way _EOS_
we now wish to
well thank you _EOS_
_eqn_ which gives _eqn_
take a look _EOS_
_SOS_ yes you do
and _eqn_ are positive
did i miss that
the moduli space metric
_SOS_ no i 've
in which the _eqn_
is n't in the
solutions of eqs _EOS_
to obtain _eqn_ _EOS_
can be absorbed into
_SOS_ that 's nothing
the trace over the
i honestly can n't
we will compute the
not think it means
of the most interesting
come up with _EOS_
in this respect the
_eqn_ as defined in
i 've never actually
_SOS_ however in order
i had a friend
the cosmological constant and
was thinking more along
_SOS_ close enough __url__
is not clear whether
close enough __url__ _EOS_
on the noncommutative torus
_SOS_ can n't we
are _eqn_ and the
as the number of
much of a difference
can n't have a
form of the potential
_eqn_ by _cite_ _EOS_
will n't let me
on the surface _eqn_
yeah i 'm a
it 's because it
they are related by
_SOS_ come at me
constant _eqn_ can be
_SOS_ to the top
illustrated in figure _cite_
_SOS_ they do not
_SOS_ to each his
_SOS_ why would it
written as _eqn_ with
a week ago _EOS_
to the set of
_SOS_ now if only
proportional to _eqn_ where
_SOS_ this is shown
not a very good
an immediate consequence of
we do n't talk
general solution to the
the sad thing is
condition _eqn_ where _eqn_
the best of the
_SOS_ let us analyze
i think you 'd
make a lot of
thus we have a
_SOS_ for simplicity let
_SOS_ i hate this
_SOS_ the most interesting
on top of that
_SOS_ sounds more like
function _eqn_ and the
figured it out _EOS_
on the parameter _eqn_
_SOS_ poe 's law
_eqn_ symmetry in the
by the requirement of
it might not be
_SOS_ hey hey hey
the vacuum energy _EOS_
the horizon of the
the whole thing is
_eqn_ does not appear
did n't realize the
expression for the _eqn_
we 're on the
how do we know
the positive and negative
about a month ago
four dimensional planck scale
is larger than the
one of the top
_SOS_ i want this
lie algebra of the
are you in the
it is also easy
_SOS_ thanks a bunch
_eqn_ can be read
i hope this is
we have used _cite_
sir well played _EOS_
the expression _cite_ _EOS_
_SOS_ i bet she
can also be seen
_SOS_ such as _EOS_
only difference is that
a non abelian gauge
when i get a
_SOS_ i will try
it would also be
be interesting to investigate
n't get the joke
make it so _EOS_
map from _eqn_ to
_SOS_ haha i have
the low energy description
_SOS_ she did n't
as follows from the
n't feed the trolls
for a few hours
which is _eqn_ _EOS_
arrow to the knee
field content of the
in this situation _EOS_
the symplectic form _eqn_
played sir well played
this is an important
_SOS_ is there anything
_SOS_ the symbol _eqn_
point of view is
you do n't you
never heard that before
the difference between _eqn_
form in terms of
no idea what i
_ix_ _ix_ _ix_ _ix_
i 'm actually a
do n't believe that
we have obtained a
along the same lines
if you do _EOS_
_eqn_ defined by _EOS_
how does that make
are you me _EOS_
the field theory on
brane i e _EOS_
i wanted to be
_SOS_ you should read
non abelian case _EOS_
if you 've never
of the d3 branes
is a redditor _EOS_
_SOS_ look at his
at _eqn_ and at
_SOS_ yeah it does
a scalar field _EOS_
_SOS_ wtf are you
each value of _eqn_
'm not sure you
a gauge transformation _eqn_
beginning of this section
n't have to do
a week or two
the metric tensor _eqn_
for most of the
let _eqn_ where _eqn_
_SOS_ _eqn_ and the
do n't think my
_SOS_ i see _EOS_
one can try to
field _eqn_ and _eqn_
this is the kind
_cite_ one obtains the
afraid of anything _EOS_
_SOS_ that one was
the t dual picture
equal to _eqn_ where
of the us _EOS_
had to go to
in _cite_ does not
we need to get
with _eqn_ in _cite_
_SOS_ i can just
in this approach the
_SOS_ for a second
runs from _eqn_ to
i still want to
with one of the
dimensional quantum field theory
now thanks for the
_eqn_ for arbitrary _eqn_
think i have a
boundary condition _eqn_ _EOS_
i was replying to
_SOS_ it is tempting
_SOS_ note that when
thanks for your input
_SOS_ i hope i
_SOS_ this is illustrated
_SOS_ you said it
cosmological constant in the
we will see this
you know i was
but i just can
gauge theories _cite_ _EOS_
_SOS_ the world sheet
space _eqn_ of the
yeah i think it
follows in section we
i 'm sorry if
_SOS_ let us give
but i 'm too
it 's a long
that _eqn_ commutes with
_SOS_ you obviously do
chosen such that _eqn_
in the infrared limit
whether or not you
_SOS_ there was an
for hospitality during the
not sure about the
now we are in
now there 's a
the metric is _eqn_
thanks for all the
this allows one to
_eqn_ does not contain
there will be no
_SOS_ of course there
_SOS_ that seems to
_SOS_ we focus on
but he 's a
_SOS_ back in the
_SOS_ in the special
_SOS_ thanks for reminding
can also be used
_SOS_ so there is
at the moment i
_SOS_ yeah well you
in the first line
_SOS_ i heard you
is now given by
_SOS_ but is n't
to the solution of
they were talking about
we shall discuss the
the character of the
were talking about the
few months ago _EOS_
it will turn out
n't think there is
then we obtain the
_SOS_ it was so
is the most general
i already have a
interesting to see if
in a straightforward way
it 's a repost
_SOS_ happened to me
we will have to
_SOS_ it implies that
on the list of
are listed in table
shit just got real
_SOS_ this is related
are more likely to
a constant _eqn_ _EOS_
wonder if it 's
_SOS_ he had a
yang mills theory and
am i right _EOS_
in the infrared _EOS_
_SOS_ i can imagine
_eqn_ as before _EOS_
the next one _EOS_
way as in the
makes me feel better
rank of the gauge
_SOS_ lol yeah i
are the components of
of people do n't
order _eqn_ in the
_SOS_ we should also
time i 've ever
i kid i kid
of the boundary states
_SOS_ of _cite_ _EOS_
like to think i
expansion of _eqn_ in
she looks like a
i came up with
the results in _cite_
_SOS_ in the brane
and _cite_ one can
as a year old
the allowed values of
would you care to
's been a long
of each of the
i was too busy
is clear that this
components of the _eqn_
it can be a
but i had to
the constraint _cite_ _EOS_
_SOS_ a little bit
_eqn_ is the vacuum
like a word with
the renormalizability of the
_SOS_ the gauge symmetry
just about to post
can be fixed by
just got back from
_SOS_ but that is
we also see that
_SOS_ duly noted _EOS_
a fixed value of
_SOS_ so it was
the phase space _EOS_
_SOS_ and i think
_eqn_ at the boundary
_SOS_ good to see
for the moment we
the imaginary time formalism
want to see that
for the gauge group
have to try it
i want to try
the fate of the
_SOS_ it takes a
in string theory and
in the schr dinger
well i 'm glad
_SOS_ challenge accepted __url__
we need to find
do n't judge me
the normalization factor _eqn_
out of your ass
the original theory _EOS_
_SOS_ give it a
_SOS_ one is the
_SOS_ the closed string
you do n't say
the integral in _cite_
this is what you
_SOS_ the hamiltonian of
's no need to
the violation of the
_SOS_ solution of the
_SOS_ you have an
_SOS_ according to our
_SOS_ maybe they 're
_SOS_ you never go
string theory on a
_SOS_ the calculation is
that i 've been
i 'm an american
stress energy tensor _EOS_
i 'd be a
the asymptotics of the
the critical value _eqn_
the joke __url__ _EOS_
makes much more sense
using _cite_ we find
black holes _cite_ _EOS_
get a chance to
i also do n't
large _eqn_ and _eqn_
_SOS_ thanks for clearing
however in order to
the leading order of
what you meant _EOS_
than or equal to
to me it 's
_eqn_ and the two
me it 's a
things i 've ever
we get for the
for example the _eqn_
there 's something wrong
been supported in part
what you 're getting
got to do with
the end of inflation
it 's not gay
to the relation _eqn_
mass is given by
to be the most
'm working on it
similar to that in
is simply _eqn_ _EOS_
n't have to _EOS_
we have to find
you 're a dick
_SOS_ but in the
explain it to me
and show that it
i 'm having trouble
if you 're gonna
it is to be
a dick about it
space _eqn_ is a
at large _eqn_ the
have to do that
the more general case
there 's at least
as a sum over
never thought about it
_SOS_ it 's up
do not change the
space is _eqn_ _EOS_
the part where you
is completely determined by
like you do n't
of it as a
we have _eqn_ this
me know what you
sine gordon model _EOS_
and _eqn_ are non
over your head _EOS_
effective action _cite_ _EOS_
what the actual fuck
_SOS_ if that was
values in _eqn_ _EOS_
seem to be the
which agrees with the
solution of the form
why would you need
_SOS_ nice i 'm
terms in the lagrangian
of the equations _cite_
so what do you
_eqn_ as _eqn_ is
would be willing to
_SOS_ where we used
is serious business _EOS_
_SOS_ _cite_ corresponds to
one on the right
i like where this
plays a crucial role
in the small _eqn_
so i was n't
_SOS_ the reason why
where do you work
_cite_ which is a
not bad at all
i read your username
low energy effective field
to get into the
was argued in _cite_
_SOS_ that 's called
solutions of the equation
'm sure he 's
of the action in
feels bad man _EOS_
the complex coordinates _eqn_
does the same thing
et al _cite_ _EOS_
by the looks of
of the manifold _eqn_
_SOS_ the classical action
was n't talking about
also be interesting to
and let me know
_SOS_ the generators _eqn_
to go ahead and
_SOS_ now _eqn_ is
_SOS_ so you 've
_eqn_ is a finite
i always think of
focus our attention on
he said he was
means that we can
the end of it
be able to tell
the gauge group and
_SOS_ now we shall
they did n't want
in the present section
went to high school
reporting for duty _EOS_
solutions to the equations
_eqn_ are shown in
it makes me feel
_SOS_ the invariance of
feel like it 's
which is obtained by
you have a lot
at least a few
the higgs branch _EOS_
is as follows _eqn_
there are too many
as a kid i
was shown to be
_SOS_ i like where
_eqn_ as given by
as an example the
i had a feeling
have to agree _EOS_
the relations between the
existence of such a
it 's pretty awesome
_SOS_ we can choose
send me a pm
the separation of the
in the seiberg witten
was n't aware that
_SOS_ if you need
which can be obtained
_eqn_ the value of
in there somewhere _EOS_
so i have to
the lagrange multiplier _eqn_
_eqn_ is the set
n't know why this
form of the solution
what i was talking
than that of the
the same thing when
_SOS_ but then i
_SOS_ let us focus
it is helpful to
that you need to
this case one can
why you were downvoted
for any _eqn_ _eqn_
no that would be
remains to be seen
she 's not a
_SOS_ in the dual
i thought it might
_eqn_ is positive and
it 's hilarious _EOS_
multiple of _eqn_ _EOS_
that 's because i
_SOS_ did you really
in order to satisfy
for the operators _eqn_
yeah i saw that
_SOS_ if you ever
that one of the
'm going to take
let us introduce a
_SOS_ came here looking
order to calculate the
the rest of his
we conclude this section
_SOS_ the simplest case
will n't be a
by requiring that the
we all know that
asymptotic expansion of the
heard of it before
_SOS_ but you have
one can define a
_SOS_ and they are
form _cite_ _eqn_ where
_SOS_ it does but
of a set of
i also have a
the first law of
'm sure you 're
the reader is referred
_SOS_ well that explains
that we have the
_SOS_ whats wrong with
order in the derivative
_SOS_ maybe she 's
had the same problem
should be considered as
mother of god _EOS_
on the existence of
_SOS_ how can i
the _eqn_ sym theory
'd be interested in
or equivalently _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ my sentiments exactly
_eqn_ is an even
_SOS_ my point was
for example for the
_SOS_ _ix_ of ref
it might as well
_SOS_ oh god why
respect to _eqn_ is
supported by nsf grant
you do n't make
_eqn_ is a unit
they 're in the
_SOS_ it 's part
it is believed that
spend a lot of
the field strength _EOS_
a change in the
i do n't speak
but i 've heard
invariant under _eqn_ and
have to check that
is identified with _eqn_
_SOS_ _eqn_ where the
did n't work for
_SOS_ it all makes
loop contribution to the
should be regarded as
supposed to be _EOS_
group _eqn_ and _eqn_
you may be right
_SOS_ with _eqn_ _eqn_
it really is a
is a link to
scope of this paper
_SOS_ is it possible
_eqn_ we can define
_eqn_ in _cite_ can
felt like i was
_SOS_ here we assume
_SOS_ i too would
i 'll check that
of the structure of
an eye out for
let us consider for
by analogy with the
i could n't believe
i look at it
using the identity _eqn_
_SOS_ i would buy
_eqn_ or _eqn_ are
_SOS_ thank god for
but we will not
necessary in order to
leads us to the
this kind of thing
_SOS_ i assure you
has a non trivial
it 's fine _EOS_
the nambu goto action
_SOS_ no prob _EOS_
the main text _EOS_
_eqn_ is the corresponding
n't figure it out
_SOS_ you should make
from string theory _EOS_
a recent paper _cite_
the same way about
'm sorry i did
_SOS_ this of course
combining _cite_ and _cite_
the rest of them
i 've seen you
takes into account the
_eqn_ of dimension _eqn_
it really is n't
_SOS_ you and your
spectrum of _eqn_ is
_SOS_ i was surprised
the fixed point set
_SOS_ the gauge theory
when i was i
know what it means
that the black hole
implies that the _eqn_
that 's exactly why
_eqn_ as a consequence
that might be the
the solutions for the
who does n't know
_SOS_ that 's for
is the area of
_SOS_ i 've lived
from _cite_ we can
's not so much
is dual to a
_SOS_ they are all
say that _eqn_ is
_SOS_ you had me
scalars _eqn_ and _eqn_
in _eqn_ where _eqn_
you pointed it out
_SOS_ ah my bad
lagrangian is given by
_SOS_ i 'm watching
that the energy density
do n't fuck with
one is left with
on the brane in
there 's a chance
's an upvote _EOS_
dimensional point of view
at the planck scale
the same way i
discussed in _cite_ the
it 's not but
do n't know man
the trace of _eqn_
_SOS_ next we will
i really wish i
_SOS_ story of my
is obtained from _cite_
_SOS_ we say that
_SOS_ you 'd better
_SOS_ to see the
is the best part
one of the better
to the boundary conditions
of the higher dimensional
shall receive __url__ _EOS_
_SOS_ the gauge fields
i 'm familiar with
it 's my first
let us compute the
are dozens of us
one can construct a
described by the following
you enjoy it _EOS_
_SOS_ ah that makes
_SOS_ we will follow
is to find a
this could be a
explicit expression for _eqn_
i 've got my
_SOS_ we shall be
n't think he was
_SOS_ do n't we
_eqn_ is spanned by
_SOS_ in fact these
die in a fire
_eqn_ is the group
really do n't want
result of this paper
here looking for this
in the massless limit
_eqn_ and this is
can i say i
_SOS_ yeah we 're
which are invariant under
_SOS_ an example is
that i have a
's the problem _EOS_
the finite part of
_SOS_ nothing at all
where _eqn_ s are
n't know why _EOS_
the _eqn_ model with
_SOS_ _ix_ in the
until i read your
cancel each other _EOS_
it on the internet
on the same page
to assume that the
taken to be the
you mean by that
_SOS_ the system of
he does n't get
the eigenvalue of _eqn_
with the exception of
for _eqn_ this is
i can say is
_SOS_ this is given
not worth it _EOS_
's a paddlin _EOS_
show that there is
_eqn_ the equations of
to tell me that
however this does not
on the right is
_SOS_ and you get
_SOS_ suppose now that
_SOS_ we are all
the latter is a
dual to _eqn_ _EOS_
to be a good
science foundation of china
try once more _EOS_
is well defined and
it just seems like
_SOS_ consider now a
to break it to
for which _eqn_ and
there was a way
i am looking for
the path integral _cite_
_SOS_ ahh i see
the noncommutativity of the
_SOS_ this symmetry is
that is what the
_SOS_ in conclusion the
_SOS_ oh shit _EOS_
in _eqn_ of the
wanted to be a
_SOS_ this allows to
out on a limb
like one of those
of spontaneous symmetry breaking
can be formulated in
did n't find it
and now it 's
symmetry group _eqn_ _EOS_
in a series of
yes it is a
_eqn_ associated to the
thanks for taking the
_SOS_ sometimes it 's
are identified with the
_SOS_ finally we will
your whore mouth _EOS_
it works for me
the uniqueness of the
good to know thanks
in _cite_ one can
belong to the same
to know thanks _EOS_
_SOS_ this implies _eqn_
god damn it _EOS_
gauge transformation of the
you 're not in
_SOS_ observe that the
not sure if the
_eqn_ and the scalar
i only have a
i knew there was
the present work is
_SOS_ this is really
the tree level superpotential
_SOS_ you accidentally a
is connected with the
_SOS_ it does _EOS_
in the functional integral
hope it does n't
to work in the
the explicit construction of
then again i 'm
_SOS_ you 're being
of the relation between
_eqn_ is the generator
that makes a lot
_SOS_ equation _cite_ can
looks like this __url__
do n't know this
up to the second
_SOS_ we choose a
you would like to
_SOS_ the sad thing
defined by eqs _EOS_
_SOS_ do n't blame
the ratio _eqn_ _EOS_
on the head _EOS_
the zeros of the
example in the case
so i 'd say
carried out in the
i dont know if
given by m _EOS_
i did and i
may be thought of
read it in the
_SOS_ let us compare
do you know why
_SOS_ no problem glad
the field strength tensor
dimensions _eqn_ and _eqn_
do n't know a
is robert paulson _EOS_
we can read off
first term is the
would be interested in
_SOS_ glad i was
the representations of _eqn_
i read somewhere that
let us take a
_SOS_ yeah and the
_eqn_ or _eqn_ where
and _eqn_ represent the
what did it say
'm sorry i 'm
of rank _eqn_ _EOS_
i 'll work on
to the space of
_SOS_ to our knowledge
on my phone and
is spontaneously broken _EOS_
no we do n't
do you even know
the gauge fixed action
_SOS_ what does the
to the one of
_eqn_ which is defined
think you may be
_SOS_ pretty sure they
note that if we
i 'm hoping for
take into account that
going to try to
note that when _eqn_
the asymptotic value of
to look forward to
and _eqn_ are some
it did n't have
_SOS_ another possibility is
only if it 's
the words right out
this is no longer
_SOS_ for instance if
words right out of
_SOS_ we shall assume
i think we 've
_SOS_ we conclude in
how would you know
_SOS_ but i thought
the possibility that the
i just saw that
that we are considering
_eqn_ is the charge
came here to see
_SOS_ did you go
_SOS_ however we are
is exactly how i
the fifth dimension is
_cite_ gives _eqn_ _EOS_
i believe you mean
in fact _eqn_ is
you do n't live
anything like that _EOS_
energy is given by
i need to see
we first note that
_SOS_ similarly one can
just leave this __url__
in a world where
we can evaluate the
a calabi yau threefold
i wonder if i
the matter on the
sounds good i 'll
this shows that _eqn_
_SOS_ using the fact
would n't it _EOS_
'll make sure to
this leads to an
_SOS_ just because it
be seen that the
going to say _EOS_
the two dimensional case
_SOS_ it 's both
of the correlation functions
have to take a
it should be clear
've never seen the
is defined by a
_SOS_ the description of
_SOS_ yeah let 's
_SOS_ one finds _eqn_
in my head for
_SOS_ please elaborate _EOS_
will be shown in
that 's hilarious _EOS_
the complex structure _eqn_
_SOS_ i wish the
the pull back of
a great deal of
you are correct i
and _eqn_ as well
take a lot of
coordinates _eqn_ on _eqn_
from the looks of
found in refs _EOS_
the way it is
defined on _eqn_ _EOS_
have one of these
it is independent of
you can n't take
_SOS_ they 're still
by the requirement that
if i could i
the authors are grateful
authors are grateful to
it 's always been
_SOS_ this just in
the dilaton field _EOS_
this case is _eqn_
you will have to
_SOS_ you had to
subalgebra of _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ as has been
_SOS_ of all the
i did n't realise
the supersymmetric case _EOS_
form of the effective
n't want to _EOS_
_SOS_ in the massless
do n't want the
_SOS_ was n't it
the limit of vanishing
_SOS_ the volume of
it 's good for
_SOS_ i would totally
black hole in the
do n't need it
is _cite_ _eqn_ where
given by _eqn_ we
wish i did n't
_SOS_ __url__ there you
bulk cosmological constant _EOS_
_SOS_ shut up _EOS_
it is an interesting
do not know how
is half the battle
and the equations of
was making a joke
it it 's just
that the coefficient of
_SOS_ it is my
are solutions of the
_SOS_ not really but
of the boundary theory
_SOS_ he 's from
one can write _eqn_
i 'm surprised you
the spirit of the
is in progress _EOS_
you remind me of
_eqn_ is just a
shit out of it
i would n't even
that they can be
_SOS_ oh god it
it has also been
defined as follows _eqn_
when i clicked on
_SOS_ epsilon _eqn_ _EOS_
i do n't smoke
_SOS_ oh yeah well
and the boundary conditions
and _eqn_ when _eqn_
sure there 's a
_SOS_ i still can
dimensional representation of _eqn_
i can only hope
the calabi yau manifold
_SOS_ holy fucking shit
to the volume of
gauge group is broken
which is what i
you can tell by
_SOS_ the leading term
_SOS_ you know nothing
both the _eqn_ and
they would n't be
_eqn_ or _eqn_ or
an upvote for your
_SOS_ you 're one
the flow of the
'm not your buddy
open and closed string
_eqn_ from which we
if you say so
i guess if you
operators _eqn_ _eqn_ _eqn_
_SOS_ if the _eqn_
have you heard of
_SOS_ i meant that
_SOS_ it leads to
_SOS_ haha i 'll
the fact that these
define _eqn_ where _eqn_
it 's just one
_SOS_ the boundary state
love to see this
_SOS_ consider the case
i dare you to
result of _cite_ _EOS_
waste of time _EOS_
of a d brane
that 's the worst
but could n't find
is played by the
_eqn_ _eqn_ and we
are n't the only
scalar field _eqn_ with
that 's like a
in addition there is
your comment made me
of the dynamics of
what i thought i
_SOS_ i mean it
of string theory in
has been supported in
i was n't a
_SOS_ the author thanks
there 's that _EOS_
_SOS_ im going to
we shall concentrate on
or at least the
term in _eqn_ _EOS_
if it was the
organization of the paper
_SOS_ but how do
see from _cite_ that
_SOS_ sounds like something
this is not so
_SOS_ no not at
to the two dimensional
_SOS_ i 'll look
equation _cite_ for _eqn_
_SOS_ except it 's
_eqn_ x _eqn_ x
it 's not on
the gauge field strength
'm going to do
to ensure that the
_SOS_ he 'll be
_eqn_ is the conformal
that you have a
the _eqn_ branes _EOS_
i 'm a dude
in the discussion of
_eqn_ does not change
a while since i
_SOS_ this must be
the instability of the
my friend and i
negative values of _eqn_
_SOS_ as discussed above
_SOS_ this one 's
_SOS_ i believe there
of the brane in
most of us are
of motion and the
're trying to say
on a _eqn_ dimensional
that the solution of
you take that back
in order to write
you 're right my
but i agree with
the following sections we
replacing _eqn_ with _eqn_
the hard way _EOS_
the following relations _eqn_
you need to go
i only have one
non abelian born infeld
_SOS_ then you have
the gauge symmetry of
_eqn_ gauge theory is
has got to be
it is just a
as mentioned above the
it may have been
a future publication _EOS_
to get a new
_eqn_ with coordinates _eqn_
it 's okay to
and _eqn_ have been
not sure i understand
annihilation and creation operators
we just need to
and you get a
any _eqn_ and _eqn_
one loop order _EOS_
who the hell is
corresponds to the case
only a matter of
of this note is
what if you 're
do you go to
that the _eqn_ are
for example consider the
that was funny _EOS_
_SOS_ my favorite is
the projection of the
n't know i 'm
we have investigated the
the _eqn_ invariance of
why do you need
i dont have a
to compare with the
_SOS_ one may wonder
can come up with
_SOS_ i 'm quite
is the induced metric
_SOS_ in the sequel
_SOS_ i 've noticed
in the case with
_SOS_ it can also
so long as you
_SOS_ we would also
would have been the
equation of motion and
kind of like a
developed in ref _EOS_
you need to do
_SOS_ let us investigate
long as it is
_SOS_ man i wish
the solution _cite_ _EOS_
_SOS_ well you could
in the sequel _EOS_
_SOS_ just as in
did n't watch the
let us make a
that they did n't
should be compared with
to be the first
total energy of the
thanks for the trade
trace of the energy
_SOS_ i fail to
two point function is
choice of _eqn_ and
i think most people
_SOS_ next time i
where this work was
and that 's all
of anti de sitter
_SOS_ let us calculate
make a good point
_SOS_ sorry that 's
we have introduced a
_SOS_ he was just
in more detail the
_SOS_ lol thanks _EOS_
dimensional conformal field theory
n't know whether to
the phase structure of
_SOS_ let 's do
_SOS_ the lambda model
should be the same
that 's why there
_SOS_ this is most
with this __url__ _EOS_
explicit construction of the
would have been more
_SOS_ i 'm willing
_eqn_ are the usual
depends on how you
equation of motion in
_SOS_ upvote for a
is a kind of
_eqn_ gauge symmetry is
i 'm here to
makes perfect sense _EOS_
the second order in
do n't worry we
solutions of these equations
_SOS_ _cite_ let us
i 'm tempted to
_SOS_ at the classical
_SOS_ we 've been
is now straightforward to
n't heard of it
_SOS_ is it the
a necessary condition for
_eqn_ the space of
it to the front
_SOS_ you just need
of the sphere _EOS_
_eqn_ implies _eqn_ _EOS_
do n't be an
consider the _eqn_ case
see what i did
that 's actually pretty
which coincides with the
by _cite_ ds _EOS_
n't see the problem
something like that i
the variables _eqn_ _eqn_
i am aware of
in order to achieve
nice try though _EOS_
worth noting that the
_SOS_ do you feel
in any case the
_SOS_ we can consider
i think there was
hell of a drug
the _eqn_ s in
solution of the field
sure if this is
the next few days
we can also consider
complex scalar field _eqn_
oh i see what
the cake is a
with a cosmological constant
_SOS_ you guys should
the gauge transformations _eqn_
_SOS_ haha well i
as _eqn_ with the
as a result _eqn_
i 'd like a
_SOS_ that 's me
the gauge potential _eqn_
of the pp wave
was going to make
for any choice of
weirdest boner right now
_cite_ we introduce the
n't think they 're
can be set to
i think of that
are not mutually exclusive
paper we study the
_SOS_ if you could
last term in eq
_eqn_ for a given
i agree with that
i do n't eat
integration over _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ he is not
us department of energy
_SOS_ did not know
the scalar curvature _eqn_
magnetic field _eqn_ _EOS_
what i can _EOS_
_SOS_ this is called
i 'm a sucker
'm a sucker for
_SOS_ since _eqn_ _eqn_
not a problem _EOS_
the scalar fields _EOS_
_SOS_ oh ok i
_SOS_ the main point
_eqn_ and the energy
no way i 'm
_SOS_ the masses of
holy shit this is
and using eq _EOS_
la la la la
_SOS_ do n't they
are defined by _EOS_
how does it feel
the orientation of the
_SOS_ in appendix b
_SOS_ you keep using
_SOS_ the world volume
using that word i
'm talking about the
this appendix we give
_SOS_ the importance of
there 's a whole
all of you _EOS_
described by the lagrangian
the name of a
awesome thanks for the
in the m theory
_SOS_ the second equation
i do n't drink
_SOS_ looks at username
integral representation of the
associated to _eqn_ _EOS_
you 're not even
have to go deeper
will be used to
be more of a
first class constraints _eqn_
_SOS_ i tried this
the gauge condition _eqn_
_SOS_ let us know
cft correspondence _cite_ _EOS_
n't hurt me _EOS_
this will allow us
'm not quite sure
straightforward to verify that
_SOS_ but do you
the conditions for the
for small _eqn_ the
get the joke _EOS_
should have been a
the coset space _eqn_
i just got it
that _eqn_ and therefore
comes from the _eqn_
for so long _EOS_
_SOS_ your comment is
_eqn_ and _eqn_ sectors
he does n't need
to make use of
action of the form
because it was a
hmm i do n't
not present in the
_SOS_ and if it
small compared to the
quantum fluctuations of the
would n't surprise me
_SOS_ how am i
_SOS_ let us therefore
fields _eqn_ where _eqn_
not what i was
_SOS_ haha it was
long as _eqn_ is
_SOS_ this is more
supersymmetric _eqn_ gauge theory
_SOS_ i think someone
_eqn_ we define _eqn_
_SOS_ the form _eqn_
this this this this
i still have the
let us use the
_eqn_ in the expression
or is it a
strong with this one
the gauge coupling _EOS_
an important role _EOS_
are correct sir _EOS_
_SOS_ in general one
in the same sentence
_SOS_ you mean it
to the metric _eqn_
for the computation of
it 's how i
_SOS_ _cite_ of the
it seems like the
_SOS_ from the _eqn_
_SOS_ what 's so
_SOS_ here we show
_SOS_ how long did
_SOS_ the first equation
no idea what it
_SOS_ guilty as charged
_eqn_ is the hamiltonian
i 'm partial to
the effective potential in
it so much _EOS_
the algebra _eqn_ of
good to go _EOS_
the complex structure moduli
_SOS_ well you are
it is proportional to
as we will discuss
coming out of the
have a sense of
the complex plane _EOS_
because it 's true
product of _eqn_ and
_SOS_ the only time
_eqn_ and with _eqn_
_SOS_ _cite_ may be
_SOS_ i 'm right
_SOS_ to illustrate this
i 'm beginning to
in your head _EOS_
the _eqn_ symmetry group
are we going to
i had to read
the right side of
i tell you _EOS_
in the limit _EOS_
commutation relations for the
that this is n't
_SOS_ well you do
of the coordinate _eqn_
is a difference between
of _eqn_ leads to
be a part of
radius of the _eqn_
_SOS_ i knew a
the final form of
is n't the only
lagrangian _eqn_ where _eqn_
i see it as
on the rhs of
coincides with the one
do it for the
's the same thing
the klein bottle amplitude
_SOS_ i just checked
where _eqn_ corresponds to
k hler potential is
ruined it for me
to go beyond the
upvote to give _EOS_
do you need to
of figure _cite_ _EOS_
choice of the gauge
it 's not bad
the georgi glashow model
this needs more upvotes
_eqn_ it is a
i loved that game
_eqn_ are _eqn_ where
pretty much the only
we require that _eqn_
what i wanted to
form of _eqn_ in
i 'm not from
_eqn_ then we can
have a great day
've never heard that
at level _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ i 'll put
_SOS_ we have chosen
see appendix _cite_ _EOS_
would love to have
_SOS_ right there with
_SOS_ the discussion of
_SOS_ you 're quite
ground state wave function
the evolution of _eqn_
when i go to
_SOS_ this reflects the
you 'll have a
in that case _eqn_
where the fuck is
_SOS_ that is actually
of the vacuum _EOS_
_SOS_ sorry i thought
the relation _eqn_ where
to that of a
you have to take
i am so sorry
to check that this
'm pretty sure there
the _eqn_ gauge fields
it 's not for
the same result _EOS_
_eqn_ is contained in
add me __url__ _EOS_
discuss the case of
i just watched that
chern simons term in
like a charm _EOS_
the flat space time
you are a god
for a week _EOS_
of the bosonic string
the middle east _EOS_
with this in mind
_SOS_ some people have
_SOS_ the ten dimensional
_SOS_ oh cool i
labelled by _eqn_ _EOS_
at _eqn_ _cite_ _EOS_
i 'm thinking it
_eqn_ and _eqn_ theories
n't bring myself to
or do you have
the requirement of the
divergent part of the
like a little girl
and did n't see
let us first discuss
seems like it 's
we can write _EOS_
_SOS_ the relation _cite_
_SOS_ there are people
components of the gauge
_SOS_ i clicked on
general structure of the
_SOS_ yes that would
to the vanishing of
i can n't _EOS_
this is so because
related by _eqn_ _EOS_
what i can tell
all the way up
with the action of
formula _eqn_ where _eqn_
yeah i know but
i know but it
of _cite_ is that
_eqn_ is arbitrary _EOS_
'm glad i could
is grateful to the
know who you are
other hand the _eqn_
_eqn_ the last term
had n't seen that
_SOS_ can you post
our attention on the
_SOS_ lol this is
_eqn_ in the adjoint
i want to make
means that in the
_SOS_ no problem man
_SOS_ the non vanishing
_SOS_ was it a
of _eqn_ on a
by the action _cite_
of the joke _EOS_
_SOS_ assume that the
i will n't _EOS_
since _eqn_ is an
_SOS_ you are now
first order differential equations
do with this _EOS_
partition function for the
_SOS_ yeah i hate
_eqn_ when _eqn_ and
_SOS_ good one _EOS_
we only consider the
i did too _EOS_
theory on _eqn_ with
_eqn_ is defined to
you were referring to
kind of a dick
the department of energy
me i can n't
using the method of
_SOS_ the expectation value
is a joke _EOS_
in the classical theory
n't see how it
_SOS_ moreover there is
i was in high
_SOS_ if you use
to the large _eqn_
it 's just as
_SOS_ and this __url__
the levi civita connection
_cite_ corresponding to the
have to be the
_SOS_ from _cite_ the
do n't take it
in the cartan subalgebra
i know you are
were studied in _cite_
_SOS_ but they do
solution of the _eqn_
_SOS_ do n't ever
at this stage _EOS_
holy shit it 's
the invariance of _eqn_
guess i 'm not
the geometry of _eqn_
_SOS_ as we already
what i was trying
form of _eqn_ and
why are you so
for the low energy
it was a bad
analyzed in _cite_ _EOS_
it depends on how
that it was the
the boundary at _eqn_
_SOS_ the field equation
what the fuck does
_SOS_ u mad bro
at the scale _eqn_
here we use the
if i do _EOS_
equation _cite_ for the
in the winter _EOS_
_SOS_ and yet you
_eqn_ and use the
at least in my
vanishes at _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ the requirement that
do it for me
_SOS_ how much is
is characterized by a
i used to get
larger values of _eqn_
're probably right _EOS_
_eqn_ while for _eqn_
and we do n't
the same manner as
about it it 's
corresponding to _eqn_ is
_SOS_ what it 's
one would have to
_eqn_ we find _EOS_
i 'm a lady
be included in the
if only there was
_SOS_ haha i thought
section _cite_ we review
_SOS_ the remainder of
none the less _EOS_
is also clear that
on a side note
the coefficients _eqn_ _eqn_
time i saw it
do n't think a
the concept of a
bosonic degrees of freedom
except for the fact
because it 's an
_cite_ with _cite_ we
could have been a
for valuable discussions and
i 'm gonna try
it appears that the
of this thread _EOS_
much the same thing
the notation _eqn_ for
_eqn_ it is straightforward
no way in hell
and _cite_ it is
use it as a
_SOS_ damn right _EOS_
the limit in which
'm sure you can
in section we derive
chosen in such a
what is this a
since _eqn_ is not
this is actually the
i 've read in
of the fields and
the following ansatz for
think he 's a
_SOS_ it 's basically
the inner product _eqn_
pole at _eqn_ _EOS_
read your comment _EOS_
then we can write
there 's always money
's always money in
is derived from the
i guess i can
metric can be written
the fifth dimension _EOS_
this is correct _EOS_
the realization of the
you get out of
best of us _EOS_
quantum field theory _cite_
parameter _eqn_ in the
that is a pretty
functions of the _eqn_
honestly i do n't
_SOS_ it 's super
_eqn_ is not zero
_SOS_ you could be
and _eqn_ are constant
not that hard to
one loop effective potential
_SOS_ are you referring
_cite_ shows that _eqn_
i guess we 'll
the free energy _EOS_
_eqn_ and its derivatives
time i 've heard
_SOS_ do n't try
the instanton moduli space
_SOS_ i had never
the gauge _eqn_ _EOS_
it 's fun to
one can see from
a lot of my
recently in _cite_ _EOS_
_SOS_ both of these
going to hell _EOS_
_SOS_ so we will
and that 's not
bps states in the
i guess you have
_SOS_ then _eqn_ where
and do n't want
_SOS_ oh god you
energy effective action of
make sure you have
the mass spectrum of
but we do not
trust me i 'm
expansion in _eqn_ _EOS_
i love that song
_SOS_ similar to the
i 'm proud of
much larger than _eqn_
why thank you i
that do n't have
we make the following
_SOS_ i 'd just
a cosmological constant _EOS_
_SOS_ indeed one can
if i remember right
n't tell if serious
the combination _eqn_ is
refer to it as
we obtain _eqn_ this
_SOS_ would you rather
can be expanded as
_SOS_ construction of the
thanks for posting this
a minimum at _eqn_
long as i can
by _eqn_ we denote
to do with your
god i 'm not
the radii of the
have the same problem
therefore _eqn_ is a
do n't remember that
on the constraint surface
singular at _eqn_ _EOS_
the second time i
by taking _eqn_ _EOS_
i go to school
about it __url__ _EOS_
hence _eqn_ and _eqn_
by the boundary conditions
sure but i think
_SOS_ i hear it
this means that for
is a good approximation
of it __url__ _EOS_
charge is given by
in the right direction
_SOS_ we also see
this is where i
on a lot of
we may use the
just so i can
to _eqn_ we have
but i live in
in the beginning of
_eqn_ as _eqn_ the
we did n't have
it does n't help
we will present the
i 'll just be
is a _eqn_ form
_SOS_ when it 's
to the effective potential
_SOS_ how about you
in _cite_ is not
at the university of
what i did _EOS_
thanks i appreciate it
unlike the case of
_SOS_ and you have
can be found for
i see you 're
phase transition in the
is the opposite of
let us first recall
_SOS_ yeah she 's
an example let us
a central role in
how can you not
_SOS_ lol i thought
the classical action _EOS_
it would be better
thus there is a
_SOS_ looking forward to
linear in _eqn_ and
believe i did n't
the energy density and
is the result of
would n't be too
_SOS_ kill it with
form _eqn_ which is
_eqn_ the result is
you can n't stop
_SOS_ _cite_ in which
no they 're not
and they did n't
of the _cite_ _EOS_
_SOS_ the lie algebra
and you 'll see
_SOS_ tell me more
non linear _eqn_ model
i 'd hit it
on the d3 brane
_SOS_ i can understand
we are forced to
and _eqn_ are also
do you think _EOS_
_SOS_ in the process
i have n't laughed
for the kind words
of the things i
we want to study
_SOS_ not for me
_eqn_ is the operator
and you should feel
from the brane _EOS_
a few weeks _EOS_
in addition to _eqn_
_SOS_ therefore we obtain
so you 're not
hit the nail on
of the _eqn_ superconformal
defined by the following
i just wish i
it bad that i
we can get the
a lot of places
the sphere _eqn_ _EOS_
i like that one
on the half line
_SOS_ it 's to
_eqn_ of order _eqn_
expression for the energy
that 's exactly the
i had forgotten about
we thus see that
one loop corrections to
until the end of
i 've heard about
on the real axis
_SOS_ would you mind
the euclidean version of
_SOS_ with this in
i wonder what the
but to be fair
the complex conjugate of
we have computed the
you could do that
satisfy the commutation relations
then it would n't
_SOS_ no but the
_SOS_ the above results
on the site _EOS_
order to do this
between the two _EOS_
of the factor _eqn_
_SOS_ i have had
to see how this
the plan of this
the wrong way _EOS_
are n't we all
k hler manifold _EOS_
_eqn_ the solution of
for one welcome our
_SOS_ there are other
this guy 's a
_SOS_ derivation of the
the part where i
the best thing ever
the theory of the
_SOS_ i 'll second
_SOS_ it would also
'd like to be
the _eqn_ point function
i 'd be down
on the _eqn_ th
_SOS_ in this approximation
any of them _EOS_
to the vacuum energy
when i try to
proportional to _eqn_ is
upvotes for everyone _EOS_
comparing _cite_ with _cite_
we should hang out
i think it should
obtained by using the
_SOS_ ah that 's
the understanding of the
that could be a
to the limit _eqn_
_SOS_ we make the
can you give me
has been argued that
the fuck did you
points of _eqn_ _EOS_
that i had to
the asymptotic expansion of
why did you have
have the form _EOS_
it 's not hard
can be solved exactly
n't seen it yet
_SOS_ go to the
_eqn_ is then given
finite value of _eqn_
only if you have
in the introduction we
to the ground _EOS_
n't look like it
will be _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ i 'm amazed
_eqn_ as in eq
_SOS_ the physical meaning
but then i realized
a new type of
i never would have
so i thought i
terms on the right
_eqn_ from _cite_ and
would n't download a
france is bacon _EOS_
starting point for the
_SOS_ for the purpose
what i 'm going
an expansion of the
have to make a
_SOS_ does anyone else
_SOS_ the index _eqn_
mass of the _eqn_
what 's your steam
it was pretty good
the case under consideration
_SOS_ one can use
was pretty good _EOS_
_SOS_ and he was
correlation functions in the
_SOS_ you really think
by _cite_ s _EOS_
in the limit that
the time it works
's a joke _EOS_
there is a non
_SOS_ oh good i
in four dimensions _cite_
shall see in the
so am i _EOS_
's what i call
run from _eqn_ to
_SOS_ note that our
_SOS_ there 's some
_cite_ so that the
some of the other
first world problem _EOS_
on the values of
forms on _eqn_ _EOS_
know how you feel
i think there are
which is nothing but
n't help it _EOS_
some concluding remarks _EOS_
on the planet _EOS_
the approach of _cite_
_eqn_ at the point
and you shall receive
_SOS_ actually this is
_SOS_ hence in the
of the vacuum state
your steam id _EOS_
_SOS_ i miss the
we can obtain a
_eqn_ or _eqn_ we
though it 's not
_eqn_ which follows from
can n't speak for
_SOS_ the final section
in his voice _EOS_
the bosonic sector of
to get back to
get back to me
the orbifold fixed points
_eqn_ is real and
that most of the
_SOS_ after that we
the best thing about
given in the previous
n't you mean carrots
one should note that
what the fuck was
as well as to
i think he has
can be integrated out
you never go full
the equation of the
you think that _EOS_
_SOS_ i just thought
_eqn_ note that this
_eqn_ are integers _EOS_
it is a bit
_SOS_ the results obtained
wow i can n't
of the original theory
zero on the final
theory is _eqn_ _EOS_
you want to play
de sitter spacetime _EOS_
is a really good
_eqn_ is even _EOS_
be wrong though _EOS_
one gets _eqn_ _EOS_
what are you trying
the constant _eqn_ in
the real world _EOS_
be the one to
this has been done
field theory of the
i found this __url__
_SOS_ we then find
did n't think i
all the _eqn_ s
just so i could
but they did n't
shall show that the
and now i have
can be taken as
the generator _eqn_ of
would you do that
_cite_ for a recent
glory to the hypnotoad
the assumption that _eqn_
to the hypnotoad _EOS_
sorry i had to
the conclusion that the
best i can do
other hand for _eqn_
_eqn_ copies of the
saying the same thing
and equations of motion
is that from _EOS_
n't make it any
the base _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ i dont understand
that _eqn_ and hence
on the right side
to quantum field theory
_SOS_ he could be
gauge field in the
that 's because they
the previous subsection we
i always thought the
of states in the
of a _eqn_ brane
to be part of
_eqn_ is the classical
a lot more _EOS_
we see that it
you do n't care
and for _eqn_ _EOS_
i totally forgot about
in the dual theory
thought as well _EOS_
_eqn_ which may be
is a genius _EOS_
_cite_ and _cite_ by
do n't worry he
_SOS_ funny thing is
of the algebra _cite_
_SOS_ that would explain
_SOS_ the tension of
_SOS_ yeah this was
_eqn_ and by _eqn_
gauge transformation _eqn_ _EOS_
you my friend _EOS_
in the r sector
to post that _EOS_
entropy of the black
i 'm gonna get
_SOS_ you could make
the electromagnetic field _EOS_
_SOS_ really __url__ _EOS_
if one wants to
have _eqn_ for _eqn_
we 're in the
me about it i
with the replacement _eqn_
this is that the
when you 're in
order to solve the
that 's a big
_SOS_ the _eqn_ brane
here in the uk
it 's the new
that the structure of
_cite_ when _eqn_ _EOS_
i never said i
but i 'd rather
of conformal field theory
_cite_ one finds _eqn_
it makes no sense
_SOS_ glad you like
do not correspond to
if we put _eqn_
it 's really a
_SOS_ _cite_ then the
can n't wait until
_SOS_ i respectfully disagree
if you 're talking
we can identify _eqn_
to be a bit
written as _cite_ _EOS_
_eqn_ the functions _eqn_
are they going to
it takes the form
so i 'll be
love to see the
related to _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ i figured that
sides of eq _EOS_
_SOS_ we have checked
cake is a lie
_SOS_ the general case
me a lot of
i can make a
the general case of
_SOS_ that was one
the identification _eqn_ _EOS_
that was kind of
the global _eqn_ symmetry
come out of the
directions transverse to the
_SOS_ even though the
n't seem to work
did n't know if
in order to prove
how do you figure
to be identified with
be viewed as an
tell me you 're
_SOS_ to leading order
that 's just not
_SOS_ this equation can
i will do that
_SOS_ _cite_ as well
about to say that
_SOS_ my god it
distance between the branes
because he did n't
can be calculated in
he 's on the
motion for _eqn_ and
_SOS_ i 'm currently
the action of this
not sure why _EOS_
the term with _eqn_
_SOS_ the one that
the continuum limit of
_SOS_ instead of the
_SOS_ not anymore _EOS_
also this __url__ _EOS_
and the gauge field
i do not have
scalar fields _eqn_ _EOS_
a _eqn_ form _eqn_
it and i 'm
_SOS_ to me it
construction of the _eqn_
so that we have
why do you want
to make a joke
x _eqn_ x _eqn_
_SOS_ so what do
we have to impose
at weak coupling _EOS_
have to ask you
or at least a
the power of _eqn_
in this one _EOS_
that they do not
maybe it 's because
structure of _eqn_ _EOS_
i guess that would
note that for the
_eqn_ that can be
one i do n't
be the case _EOS_
it 's beautiful _EOS_
i 'll bring the
will be considered in
i would n't do
supergravity equations of motion
next time i 'll
which is based on
that was what i
there is however a
_SOS_ i know they
the _eqn_ matrix is
say i do n't
space of the _eqn_
of my favorite things
the base of the
make you feel better
since it does not
_eqn_ since _eqn_ and
at one point _EOS_
_SOS_ why not both
where _eqn_ in the
in addition we have
what 's the deal
_SOS_ the non perturbative
was just making a
exactly the kind of
the _eqn_ heterotic string
_SOS_ this guy knows
we can make the
_SOS_ in the particular
thought about it but
're going to need
the penrose limit of
_SOS_ however this does
second this motion _EOS_
answer the question _EOS_
for the energy momentum
so _eqn_ and _eqn_
the other way _EOS_
_SOS_ what a great
on _eqn_ or _eqn_
in that order _EOS_
only when _eqn_ _EOS_
similar to those of
the key point is
this might be the
metric on the moduli
tell the difference between
in the space _eqn_
that may be the
_SOS_ i 'm _EOS_
_eqn_ and _eqn_ representations
in the sequel we
on the final _EOS_
'm trying to get
where _eqn_ are constants
_SOS_ good call i
_SOS_ times _eqn_ _EOS_
no pun intended _EOS_
we find _cite_ _EOS_
_SOS_ who said anything
we would also like
each their own _EOS_
used to calculate the
_SOS_ that 's still
_eqn_ so that it
_SOS_ finally in the
too but i 'm
_SOS_ but i am
can be chosen as
of the clifford algebra
thought it might be
_SOS_ he 's only
function _eqn_ is the
'm just saying that
_eqn_ action on the
the explicit expression of
what it feels like
_cite_ _eqn_ is a
do n't they _EOS_
_SOS_ do you need
_SOS_ the gauge transformations
_SOS_ we use a
is the point of
_SOS_ the main purpose
what i was saying
boundary conditions _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ one may also
_SOS_ they could have
i should have known
used in this paper
of the ns5 branes
so we do n't
order _eqn_ and _eqn_
why i love reddit
_SOS_ yeah there is
defined with respect to
_SOS_ care to share
obtained in the previous
some people are just
the origin of _eqn_
case as well _EOS_
take care of it
_SOS_ yeah it looks
_eqn_ will be called
_SOS_ we denote _eqn_
i 'm assuming that
_SOS_ but i can
an important feature of
be the first time
by the value of
a good way _EOS_
with _eqn_ as in
from _cite_ it is
i wanted to make
_SOS_ i 'm calling
there are two possible
for the _eqn_ _eqn_
what makes you say
that there was a
the brane world volume
_eqn_ term in _cite_
do n't like you
_SOS_ i absolutely love
equations of motion with
is that they are
in the woods _EOS_
of ads cft correspondence
'll have to take
the _eqn_ charge of
_SOS_ to proceed we
that you are a
in section iv _EOS_
that 's because he
of the randall sundrum
that would make sense
for example we can
that 's exactly how
for the operator _eqn_
i thought that 's
at _eqn_ for _eqn_
if that was the
is n't there a
the observation that the
_SOS_ in this form
this is a picture
_SOS_ joke 's on
of the supersymmetry _EOS_
_SOS_ we 're gonna
_eqn_ according to _eqn_
feel like an idiot
in _eqn_ which is
the following expression _eqn_
was the best _EOS_
_SOS_ i hear the
_eqn_ and set _eqn_
_eqn_ commutes with the
we 'll do it
_SOS_ thus we need
made me smile _EOS_
is probably my favorite
will be discussed elsewhere
i have n't watched
the neighborhood of the
a complex scalar field
does n't mean anything
_SOS_ so he 's
result is _eqn_ _EOS_
make it happen _EOS_
of the construction of
fuck fuck fuck fuck
in section _cite_ that
the general solution for
you enjoyed it _EOS_
from the results of
you are the one
came to the comments
us consider now the
_SOS_ you 'll never
of the _eqn_ plane
of the lagrangian _EOS_
you 're the first
_SOS_ haha i guess
the one form _eqn_
be discussed in section
that is true _EOS_
do n't you take
the general case the
i 'm sick of
in the bulk is
and _eqn_ _eqn_ where
no but it 's
_SOS_ i know my
precise form of the
conclusion and discussion _EOS_
to make it a
's the best part
we are working in
the correct term is
the higgs branch of
_eqn_ is denoted by
when i lived in
a little more _EOS_
the addition of a
the solution to eq
to see more of
'll check that out
at the singularity _EOS_
it 's pretty easy
the flat space limit
of d0 branes _EOS_
on my list _EOS_
and i would n't
the us department of
if i told you
that at _eqn_ the
it 's always the
on the l h
ask and ye shall
the reason why we
of the world 's
two dimensional quantum gravity
in the face of
the brane _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ so in this
i 'm looking to
's all good i
the evaluation of _eqn_
the gross neveu model
would have been nice
_SOS_ does it really
_SOS_ note that all
in turn implies that
just think it 's
's talking about the
the perturbative expansion of
consider the case in
yeah it 's pretty
_SOS_ i was too
the statement that the
is what i came
it coincides with the
_SOS_ haha that was
for the ground state
_SOS_ we get the
like i do n't
be seen to be
do n't you like
that _eqn_ in _cite_
want to live in
do not commute _EOS_
for the input _EOS_
_SOS_ where _eqn_ the
the other day i
these degrees of freedom
you even read the
interesting to consider the
n't have to go
the first non trivial
working for me _EOS_
the contribution to _eqn_
what i want _EOS_
half of the supersymmetry
to the party _EOS_
_SOS_ apparently it 's
of the hamiltonian _cite_
and _eqn_ s are
it 's not his
_SOS_ how could i
as a simple example
_SOS_ why 's that
the main features of
this model is given
thought you were a
is beyond me _EOS_
written in the following
determine _eqn_ and _eqn_
have thought of that
did n't go to
that _eqn_ is given
_cite_ by _eqn_ _EOS_
low energy description of
think that 's how
so that you can
the one point function
phase space of the
you must not have
do n't really need
turn now to the
_eqn_ and take the
know what i was
that does n't exist
this section let us
_SOS_ no one will
the t duality transformation
_SOS_ after some algebra
about to say the
a solution of _cite_
i 've been here
do n't mess with
we get _eqn_ which
i have n't gotten
that the large _eqn_
it is a very
we find that for
fine tuning of the
makes me happy _EOS_
_eqn_ as long as
at the moment but
_SOS_ we use _eqn_
_SOS_ wow it 's
are similar to those
but it 's true
i got your back
of the first kind
in the bps limit
there is n't any
_SOS_ just wanted to
the ir fixed point
of the spacetime _EOS_
so did i _EOS_
singularity at the origin
that 's when i
a mass term for
gauge field on the
one way or the
of the early universe
way or the other
then it 's a
to solve eq _EOS_
_SOS_ i 'm american
for _eqn_ with the
_SOS_ there are dozens
i e _eqn_ and
_SOS_ fuck i 'm
to set _eqn_ _EOS_
i can n't make
this subsection we will
_SOS_ back in my
_SOS_ in this picture
_cite_ and it is
i thank you for
do n't get how
the metric is given
_SOS_ _cite_ into the
know a lot of
it 's definitely a
lie group _eqn_ _EOS_
_eqn_ are equal to
and raise you a
follows from _cite_ _EOS_
just trying to get
_SOS_ i know exactly
_eqn_ a _eqn_ _EOS_
know if you 're
two terms in _cite_
but i 'd say
under a gauge transformation
i know is that
the _eqn_ function in
because it 's so
we can apply the
_SOS_ i like them
at _eqn_ we have
's not just a
_SOS_ owing to the
and do n't have
i would n't worry
work is partially supported
_SOS_ depends on your
_eqn_ gauge field _EOS_
from _cite_ we get
to stay away from
_eqn_ or _eqn_ respectively
word i do not
_SOS_ yeah man i
be used for the
been shown to be
i used to go
lead to the following
that does n't seem
_SOS_ sweet thanks _EOS_
_SOS_ the expansion of
but it seems like
in the conformal field
_SOS_ this explains the
of course you can
_SOS_ dental plan _EOS_
mass and angular momentum
a lot of that
field and _eqn_ is
eigenvalues _eqn_ and _eqn_
reminds me of my
i love how you
the results for _eqn_
not sure what that
performed in _cite_ _EOS_
field _eqn_ which is
i had to guess
is so much more
now let _eqn_ be
_SOS_ those are n't
when _eqn_ i e
like a bunch of
theory and m theory
a fucking idiot _EOS_
action takes the form
_eqn_ as _eqn_ with
it 's for a
could say the same
the contribution from _eqn_
_SOS_ nice thanks _EOS_
and _eqn_ branes _EOS_
equations on the brane
pull it off _EOS_
did n't feel like
the _eqn_ with _eqn_
are not going to
end up with the
i would think that
in this case are
all values of the
thank you for pointing
as follows _eqn_ the
time i see it
_SOS_ yeah it would
in order to give
be interpreted as an
for the laugh _EOS_
_SOS_ consider the _eqn_
_SOS_ it 's your
i always wanted to
we have for the
but it 's really
setting _eqn_ and _eqn_
on top of it
the contributions to the
in this paper and
love that song _EOS_
_eqn_ down to _eqn_
i thought the exact
it is understood that
me think of this
thus we have the
what they 're doing
denotes the derivative with
the best kind _EOS_
we also assume that
wtf is wrong with
_eqn_ _cite_ _eqn_ _EOS_
_SOS_ we can take
the difference is that
_eqn_ is _eqn_ which
do n't care how
did i miss something
figure _cite_ shows the
about it i 'm
we shall study the
but if it 's
of the weyl group
_SOS_ then from _cite_
that 's a bad
in terms of gauge
thank god i 'm
schr dinger equation _cite_
will n't regret it
have been known to
where the coefficients _eqn_
can be treated in
i believe that was
_SOS_ now one can
it 's in my
_SOS_ why is he
that _cite_ and _cite_
in fact there are
see a picture of
n't figure out how
symmetry is broken to
_SOS_ what are they
must be of the
group is _eqn_ and
it was the same
_SOS_ hahaha i 'm
the metric for the
_SOS_ no sorry _EOS_
introduced in ref _EOS_
i really wanted to
is believed to be
_SOS_ yeah i actually
the standard model is
a total of _eqn_
and it 's been
e g ref _EOS_
how the hell do
_SOS_ it reminds me
will be shown that
_cite_ with _eqn_ the
there are tons of
properties of _eqn_ _EOS_
there is a reason
the generators _eqn_ and
we 're not all
_SOS_ can you link
the derivatives of _eqn_
be used to calculate
i 've been wanting
goes a long way
the massless case _EOS_
_SOS_ damn you i
of _cite_ is given
_SOS_ _cite_ one obtains
that was a joke
and see if it
the closed string channel
_SOS_ me too man
there are two different
_eqn_ rather than the
robe and wizard hat
shit like that _EOS_
the large n limit
_SOS_ the third term
thought i was going
_SOS_ we had a
the angular momentum _eqn_
_SOS_ we choose to
n't matter had sex
_eqn_ do not depend
on the internet and
_SOS_ there are four
if you 've ever
scared the shit out
the origin _eqn_ _EOS_
by the department of
do n't plan on
are described by a
i was like wtf
stress energy tensor of
then who was phone
_SOS_ for the same
