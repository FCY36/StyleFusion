as i turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and fluttered off among the others .
above all , he hated my young legitimate heir from the first with a persistent hatred .
it is , indeed !
in whose interest are you acting , may i ask ?
a few members of the lodge , ted baldwin among them , resented the rapid rise of the stranger and hated him for it but they kept clear of him , for he was as ready to fight as to laugh .
i explained , however , the importance of my errand , and promised faithfully to call and report any progress which we might make with the case .
never .
on the path , too , and among the heather were dark stains of clotted blood .
i cried ,
meanwhile ,
it was most unfortunate , sir but i have occasionally done the same thing at other times .
when you pass bradley ' s , would you ask him to send up a pound of the strongest shag tobacco ?
stand by me and we 'll save her , if i have to leave my carcass in charlington wood .
but i am very much mistaken if this is not hatherley farm upon the left .
and he laid it across holmes 's knee .
sherlock holmes sat moodily at one side of the fireplace cross indexing his records of crime , while i at the other was deep in one of clark russell 's fine sea stories until the howl of the gale from without seemed to blend with the text , and the splash of the rain to lengthen out into the long swash of the sea waves .
may i smoke as i talk ?
i could not find anything in the nature of a distinct impression , but the grass was trodden down , and someone had undoubtedly passed .
well , if you will n't , i will .
take your husband into your confidence .
we have always been friends .
look at his long letters ,
this is unworthy of you , holmes ,
theresa wright is her name , and the kind of maid you do n't pick up nowadays .
where was i , sir ?
i have my plans laid , and all will be well .
might i ask how you know , and how much you know ?
mcmurdo read the note twice with the utmost surprise for he could not imagine what it meant or who was the author of it .
if then your eye goes on to read this line , i know that i shall already have been exposed and dragged from my home , or as is more likely , for you know that my heart is weak , by lying with my tongue sealed forever in death .
now , what could jonathan small do ?
and now , gentlemen ,
i am a plumber with a rising business , escott , by name .
for two hours the strange business in which we had been involved appeared to be forgotten , and he was entirely absorbed in the pictures of the modern belgian masters .
and so , my dear watson , we have ended by turning the dancing men to good when they have so often been the agents of evil , and i think that i have fulfilled my promise of giving you something unusual for your notebook .
but i waited for none of the landlord 's explanations .
excellent , lestrade , excellent !
he wished to return with me .
have you never heard of the ku klux klan ?
when we were taking coffee in the drawing room that night after dinner , i told arthur and mary my experience , and of the precious treasure which we had under our roof , suppressing only the name of my client .
the printed messages , as is now evident , were to prevent her sex being discovered by her writing .
i cannot think where she is .
he looked across at me , as i stirred , and i noticed that his face was dark and troubled .
that fatal night dr roylott had gone to his room early , though we knew that he had not retired to rest , for my sister was troubled by the smell of the strong indian cigars which it was his custom to smoke .
baldwin looked at him in amazement .
suppose that it were so suppose that the same man had been the last who had seen sir charles alive , and the first to dog the new heir when he returned to england .
cried the inspector , with the magnificent fair play of the british criminal law .
clair had been deluded when , with a cry , she sprang at a small deal box which lay upon the table and tore the lid from it .
tells at a glance different soils from each other .
finally he thrust the sharp point home , pressed down the tiny piston , and sank back into the velvet lined arm chair with a long sigh of satisfaction .
i am emilia lucca , and we are both from new york .
it matters nothing to me that you should know how my nephew died .
i see my sentry at his post ,
this was my conversation with barrymore just now , which gives me one more strong card which i can play in due time .
there 's the cab off again !
you 'll learn to bless my name before you 've done with me .
we 'll have some food first .
i had gone up to ask him about you , and he was very offensive accused me of coaxing you away from the service of the firm , and that sort of thing .
you have a very handsome stick , ' i answered .
a moment later he was the cold and practical thinker once more .
mcmurdo laughed .
what data could he expect from an uncleaned watch ?
but remember , ' he added , tapping me lightly on the chest and giggling , ' if you speak to a human soul about this one human soul , mind well , may god have mercy upon your soul !
it was very long , though almost as long , watson , as when you and i waited in that deadly room when we looked into the little problem of the speckled band .
take him to the main guard ,
the postmark is london eastern division .
well , i understand that they get five pounds if they can give information .
i beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands ,
every week end i went home to my mother in town .
i do n't know that your assistant is not as remarkable as your advertisement .
the instant that we heard it , holmes sprang from the bed , struck a match , and lashed furiously with his cane at the bell pull .
eight of us , five convicts and three sailors , said that we would not see it done .
it is only fair to them to say that .
well , my man ,
come in here , if you please .
if there were only one , ' he said .
it was just who would get his evidence first .
first of all , it is enormous in size .
it had lasted some minutes before the young lady broke in upon it .
the older man sat in that wicker chair it was he who used the cigar holder .
here is a man who slips into a house with the deliberate intention of committing murder .
a few minutes later we were in the study .
in a doubtful case i would not put him in so painful a position , and so i reserve my information until my own mind is clear upon the matter .
from outside came the occasional cry of a night bird , and once at our very window a long drawn catlike whine , which told us that the cheetah was indeed at liberty .
well , what is it ?
a man 's or a woman ' s ?
seen the paris news ?
but you have had enough of the case .
an examination of his room revealed that the bed had not been slept in , that a safe which stood in it was open , that a number of important papers were scattered about the room , and finally , that there were signs of a murderous struggle , slight traces of blood being found within the room , and an oaken walking stick , which also showed stains of blood upon the handle .
if you work against me i must expose you .
he gazed at me with bleared , drunken eyes for a moment , and then i saw a horror spring up in them , and convulse his whole features , which showed me that he knew me .
that must have saved them trouble ,
it was about the late sir charles baskerville that i have come here to see you .
i was going to propose it , mr holmes but i thought it well to put you in touch with all the facts before we go .
and yet , consider that every baskerville who goes there meets with an evil fate .
holmes gazed long and earnestly at it .
a house on fire ?
there is but one danger which can threaten us .
on the issue of this question depended whether i should continue my work at briony lodge , or turn my attention to the gentleman 's chambers in the temple .
that last warning cry had been suddenly cut short .
but it 's over to night , thank god , and i am the winner !
i have driven down to tell you so .
the muscles are as hard as a board ,
but i will make allowance for your natural anger .
i had it by the barrel , and we wrestled for it all ends up for a minute or more .
my scholar has been left very poor , but he is hard working and industrious .
well , if you think it necessary , i will tell these gentlemen what occurred .
i apologize , eminent bodymaster , to you and to every brother in this lodge if i have said more than i should .
she continued ,
we saw the cold winter sun rise over the dreary marshes of the thames and the long , sullen reaches of the river , which i shall ever associate with our pursuit of the andaman islander in the earlier days of our career .
holmes whistled .
i took off the kettle and blew out the lamp , for the water was spurting over the floor .
what do you think that this unfortunate lady died of , then ?
i have thought it all out to the last detail .
you are not so new that you can n't give a gentleman his proper title .
but it was you who broke her innocent heart , ' i shrieked , thrusting the box before him .
but the german does not do so .
you will recollect that mortimer tregennis , in describing the episode of his last visit to his brother 's house , remarked that the doctor on entering the room fell into a chair ?
yellow leaves carpeted the lanes and fluttered down upon us as we passed .
i was not such a selfish hound as that .
and who is this captain calhoun ?
there are small lateral columns of water outside which receive the force , and which transmit and multiply it in the manner which is familiar to you .
one of them is a letter of instructions from colonel ross .
perhaps you would care to try ?
from that day these outrages have never ceased , until now they have reached a pitch which makes us the opprobrium of the civilized world .
then , good night .
the german lay upon the sofa sleeping stertorously with a strap round his upper arms and another round his legs .
there were ten or a dozen boarders there but they were honest foremen or commonplace clerks from the stores , of a very different calibre from the young irishman .
none , sir , none .
why a fire ?
he was flying like a racer .
that is my intention .
he soon realized that even his iron constitution could not stand the incessant strain which he was putting upon it .
there 's only the one exit to these flats , so we have him safe .
come , sir , come !
i have made my case out , and it seems i was wrong .
for myself , i felt elated at the thought that we were nearing the end of our task , and i caught something of holmes 's gaiety .
i understand ,
but he could not help me in any way .
come this way .
a dabbler in science , mr holmes , a picker up of shells on the shores of the great unknown ocean .
three weeks had passed since jefferson hope and his comrades had departed from salt lake city .
was dressed , when last seen , in black frock coat faced with silk , black waistcoat , gold albert chain , and grey harris tweed trousers , with brown gaiters over elastic sided boots .
for three days and three nights he had allowed himself neither rest nor repose .
they have now fled together .
what do you mean by that ?
you were always good to me .
simon bitterly .
so absorbed was he in his thoughts , i remember , that he stumbled over the watering pot , upset its contents , and deluged both our feet and the garden path .
presently he came to himself once more , very weary and pale looking .
i dine at seven .
he gave an exclamation that was all .
dismal as it was outside , i was glad within so glad that i could have shouted out from pure exultation .
what was it ?
i promised you once that i would go some day .
sure , it is not very bad , my sweetheart .
have you been there yourself , mr roundhay ?
have you got them ?
a small black cavity opened beneath it .
no he is clean dazed .
mr treasurer ,
for example , what a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another room , when , with the same trouble , he might have communicated with the outside air !
that opening of the door which i had heard after i had returned to my room might mean that he had gone out to keep some clandestine appointment .
so that three days have been wasted .
in my own bureau .
my indignation at this calm examination of our family documents overcame me so far that i took a step forward , and brunton , looking up , saw me standing in the doorway .
the reward .
that was why i thought to speak with you .
you have a bit of paper beside you there .
here , on the left hand , there stands a shop window filled with photographs of the celebrities and beauties of the day .
what is his own explanation as to the paper which he wished the maid to give to the stable boy ?
i simply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine which has got out of gear .
oh , very good ,
what is the use of having brains in our profession .
put your pistol in your pocket .
as a matter of course i did the same .
at the end of broad street it ran right down to the water 's edge , where there was a small wooden wharf .
they were buzzards , the vultures of the west , whose coming is the forerunner of death .
and if it were guilty , why did he not invent a lie ?
i 'm not very good at telling a story , dr watson , but it is like this with me :
if i can get gorgiano
wait up for me .
as a matter of fact , that screw was not used .
did you see him then ?
that will be easily arranged .
i assure you , however , that i never even knew that you had a brother until you handed me the watch .
it seemed strange to us that uncle ralph , who took no notice of us when he was alive , should be so careful to look after us when he was dead , but mr carruthers explained that the reason was that my uncle had just heard of the death of his brother , and so felt responsible for our fate .
my heart turned to water , for there was no sign of the stone , and i knew that some terrible mistake had occurred .
it was after tea on a summer evening , and the conversation , which had roamed in a desultory , spasmodic fashion from golf clubs to the causes of the change in the obliquity of the ecliptic , came round at last to the question of atavism and hereditary aptitudes .
now , now , at this very moment , alexis , a man whose name you are not worthy to speak , works and lives like a slave , and yet i have your life in my hands , and i let you go .
there is no indication as to the sender , and the matter is the more mysterious as miss cushing , who is a maiden lady of fifty , has led a most retired life , and has so few acquaintances or correspondents that it is a rare event for her to receive anything through the post .
it was a poky , little , shabby genteel place , where four lines of dingy two storied brick houses looked out into a small railed in enclosure , where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smoke laden and uncongenial atmosphere .
am i to lose my life 's chance and all my heart 's desire for someone else ?
scanlan groaned sympathetically .
how did it run ?
i dare say that in the course of the day i shall drop in at norwood and see how you are getting on .
i have hopes .
but soon he found that that would not answer forever .
precisely .
i guess he did n't come into these parts to look at the prospect .
no , mr holmes had no desire to see him , but would be glad to know more about his record and character .
perhaps not with your tongue , my dear watson , but certainly with your eyebrows .
never mind warning me , inspector : i 'm ready to stand pat upon the truth .
if it is anything in the nature of a problem which you desire to see solved , i should strongly recommend you to come to my friend , mr sherlock holmes , before you go to the official police .
stand at the window here .
he took a sheaf of worn and greasy forms from his pocket .
then perhaps , mr holmes , you will be good enough to explain how it is that i have received a letter from him to day .
no one there , i suppose ?
the treasure , however , was a different matter .
all well .
au revoir , and good morning !
james was seized with horror at the news .
here the dog , frantic with excitement , turned down through the side gate into the enclosure , where the sawyers were already at work .
if you were to search all england ,
the musgrave ritual
step into my room here . it was a small , office like room , with a huge ledger upon the table , and a telephone projecting from the wall .
leave the rest to me .
of these servants the one who had been longest in our service was brunton the butler .
was ever such bad luck and such bad management , too ?
if i take it up i must understand every detail ,
degrees ' on nov .
nothing , sir
i shrugged my shoulders .
all right ,
he is looking up at the numbers of the houses .
perhaps , since the matters which we have to discuss will affect you personally in a very intimate fashion , it is as well that we should talk where there can be no eavesdropping .
at last , however , there was the glint of a candle behind the blind , and a face looked out at the upper window .
the french or the russian embassy would pay an immense sum to learn the contents of these papers .
one of them fired a shot , the other dropped , and the murderer rushed across the garden and over the hedge .
it 's down in kent , seven miles from chatham and three from the railway line .
no marks could show on the grass .
about sending you .
but facts are facts , and i have twice heard this crying upon the moor .
there was a calm assurance of power in holmes 's manner which could not be withstood .
let me hear you reconstruct the man by an examination of it .
in the first instance that of the tregennis family this substance was placed in the fire .
together we flung ourselves upon it once more , and this time it gave way with a sudden snap , and we found ourselves within bartholomew sholto 's chamber .
there was an old manservant at merripit house , whose name was anthony .
it has , therefore , been in the hands of your eldest brother .
i have told no one else .
it has been found in the front garden of an empty house in campden house road .
you could easily recognize it , could you not ?
yes , that is all .
yet the old man never wavered in his resolution to part with life itself before he consented to what he regarded as his daughter 's dishonour .
he has an impression that the man was tall , had a reddish face , and was dressed in a long , brownish coat .
he was languidly interested by the papers in his hand , and page after page was turned as he followed the argument of the lawyer .
shall i go and order you a cab ?
above the woods which lined it upon the farther side we could see the red , jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the rich landowner 's dwelling .
the thing takes shape , watson .
well , then ,
that should mean t .
i had returned to civil practice and had finally abandoned holmes in his baker street rooms , although i continually visited him and occasionally even persuaded him to forgo his bohemian habits so far as to come and visit us .
how do you know that the woman is his wife ?
come here ,
the sandal wearing mohammedan has the great toe well separated from the others , because the thong is commonly passed between .
he is either a foreigner or has lived long in the tropics , for he is yellow and sapless , but tough as whipcord .
from the end of it a small wand planted here and there showed where the path zigzagged from tuft to tuft of rushes among those green scummed pits and foul quagmires which barred the way to the stranger .
they have looked after the hall for four generations now .
until then i will be responsible for him .
because i order it .
briefly ,
watson , watson , if you are an honest man you will record this also and set it against my successes !
its somewhat ambitious title was the book of life , and it attempted to show how much an observant man might learn by an accurate and systematic examination of all that came in his way .
are you sure that you are really fit to discuss things ?
to all this information , much of which we already knew , holmes listened with polite attention , but i , who knew him so well , could clearly see that his thoughts were elsewhere , and i detected a mixture of mingled uneasiness and expectation beneath that mask which he was wont to assume .
i had some vague recollection of an explanation at the time of the adventure of the greek interpreter .
i trust , sir , that you will succeed in proving , what i feel sure is the truth , that my cousin arthur is innocent of this crime .
there are a few gipsies and labouring folk for whom i can n't answer , but among the farmers or gentry there is no one whose initials are those .
the dead man lay on his back , sprawling with outstretched limbs in the centre of the room .
presently it was thrown open with a whining of hinges , and we could dimly see the dark outline of a man 's head and shoulders looking out into the gloom .
there were articles in most of the papers upon the norwood tragedy .
from this central point two long corridors extended the whole length of the building , from which all the bedrooms opened .
but i did n't quite follow your explanation of the destruction of the busts .
we were admitted by a strange , wizened , rusty coated old manservant , who seemed in keeping with the house .
what o'clock were those curtains drawn ?
you are like my friend , dr watson , who has a bad habit of telling his stories wrong end foremost .
but the under side is as stained as the upper .
not know ?
occasionally .
he had guessed who his visitors were .
i am an old campaigner , and if i were not i can very well see that no apology is needed .
you know my methods .
you 'll want it ,
yes , madam , he has been here .
they slept at the extreme back of the house , and could not possibly have heard anything .
percy phelps and his nurse looked at holmes during this demonstration with surprise and a good deal of disappointment written upon their faces .
we thought that if we could only find good heavens , mr holmes !
no ill will , mr melas , i hope , but we could not get on without you .
of course it is locked at night .
corresponding member of the swedish pathological society .
pray give my greetings to mrs watson , and believe me to be , my dear fellow ,
as it opened there came a tumultuous rush into the hall , rapid feet clattered up the stair , and an instant later a wild eyed and frantic young man , pale , disheveled , and palpitating , burst into the room .
and actually signed ,
yet may we shelter ourselves in the infinite goodness of providence , which would not forever punish the innocent beyond that third or fourth generation which is threatened in holy writ .
mcmurdo was absorbed and silent but he showed no sympathy for the weakening of his companion .
there is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man or men are is a sailing ship .
what , then , might she be expected to do if she heard of his death ?
well , if you take that line , mr barker ,
i thought at first that you had done something clever , but i see that there was nothing in it , after all .
the idea was that one of you was to marry her , and the other have a share of the plunder .
mrs douglas thought earnestly before she answered .
a gold wedding ring in the brixton road .
you hold your own pipe to the lamp , and see how naturally you , being right handed , hold the left side to the flame .
have your fare ready , and the instant that your cab stops , dash through the arcade , timing yourself to reach the other side at a quarter past nine .
i cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning ,
sherlock holmes approached the body , and , kneeling down , examined it intently .
round this corner were three doors in a line , the first and third of which were open .
it was at this instant that my unfortunate husband entered the room .
you could not find a more lonely tract of road anywhere , and it is quite rare to meet so much as a cart , or a peasant , until you reach the high road near crooksbury hill .
have you the cab below ?
there was digging , and ditching , and yam planting , and a dozen other things to be done , so we were busy enough all day though in the evening we had a little time to ourselves .
the dead man 's papers had not been tampered with .
you are at liberty , sir , to give your account , which i again warn you will be taken down .
a small fragment of the wood was hanging down .
it was twenty five minutes past four .
i have hold of it now .
he shrieked .
the absence of the i dots in the old man 's writing is also most characteristic .
take it and read it to me , for i have neither the strength nor the courage to do it myself .
if you would give me an account of it .
no , mr holmes .
the table was piled with half eaten dishes and dirty plates , the debris of last night 's dinner .
he is a harmless enough fellow , parker by name , a garroter by trade , and a remarkable performer upon the jew ' s harp .
he simply wished , i should imagine , to refresh his memory upon that last occasion .
the ' cooee !
if you could accompany me in that last step you might be of considerable service to me .
the total income , which at the time of the wife 's death was little short of pounds , is now , through the fall in agricultural prices , not more than pounds .
probably what i should have done myself .
that is back through the house into saxe coburg square .
i knew that you did it .
at last , by a sudden impulse , just as our train was crawling out of a suburban station , he sprang on to the platform and pulled me out after him .
he was more masterful than ever .
stapleton himself seems to have been capable of jealousy , and when he saw the baronet paying court to the lady , even though it was part of his own plan , still he could not help interrupting with a passionate outburst which revealed the fiery soul which his self contained manner so cleverly concealed .
do n't mind that , sir : it 's only a slow worm .
we 'll see about that !
a black funnel , you say ?
i hai n't said none since i was half the height o that gun .
they had reached the base of the hill by this time , and were surrounded by crowds of the pilgrims pale faced meek looking women , strong laughing children , and anxious earnest eyed men .
i exclaimed , and then suddenly realizing how he had echoed the inmost thought of my soul , i sat up in my chair and stared at him in blank amazement .
we all need help sometimes ,
, cocktail s .
the worthy country policeman shook his head .
one thing only is certain .
i shall bring him , then ,
well , how do you explain it ?
then you 'll need to kneel down , and me too ,
he would probably consider that to send back the launch or to keep it at a wharf would make pursuit easy if the police did happen to get on his track .
it was half past five before holmes returned .
well , so was jack james an american citizen , but he 's doing time in portland all the same .
oh , certainly , certainly ,
there are no signs here , but the ground is iron hard , and one would not expect them .
a warder , no doubt ,
we sat down about nine o'clock .
she cried , shaking hands with us warmly .
my happiness , his happiness , our very lives are at stake !
if you choose to call the police , let the police find what they can .
and i should be glad to have change of this five pound note .
he had insisted , however , upon efficiency in the work , and had , therefore , paid off certain drunken and idle employees who were members of the all powerful society .
thank you .
again , both father and son agreed as to the place where the man escaped into the road .
this is more interesting than it promised to be quite dramatic , in fact .
it hinged back like the lid of a box .
he did not wish to put his head in a halter .
would you wish dinner to be served at once , sir ?
a minute later we were both in a hansom , driving furiously for the brixton road .
that the writer was on board of a ship .
one other point .
the light shone steadily as if he were standing motionless .
he is a man of venerable appearance and of saintly life .
come breakfast to morrow at nine thirty .
ah , holmes ,
it was a quarter past seven when we left pall mall , and my watch showed me that it was ten minutes to nine when we at last came to a standstill .
my dear fellow , i would not miss it for anything .
my boys had been up the river and down the river without result .
excellent , warner !
having once recognized , however , that the symbols stood for letters , and having applied the rules which guide us in all forms of secret writings , the solution was easy enough .
is that her ring ?
holmes left us standing at the door and walked slowly all round the house , across the front , down the tradesmen 's path , and so round by the garden behind into the stable lane .
where , then ?
i tell you , sir , i could n't move a finger , nor get my breath , till it whisked away and was gone .
with regard to our transaction , you will no doubt have observed by now that one essential detail is missing .
i do n't know what he would say if i brought you in that sudden way .
just give me a help with this buckle , cabman ,
i bowed , feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an address .
come , man , come , if you really are her friend .
i did not positively say so .
it is a capital mistake to theorize before you have all the evidence .
the latter had not been raised .
toby led us to the very edge of this , and there stood whining , looking out on the dark current beyond .
good night .
we have gained that much .
why , morton or johnson , the oxford fliers , could romp round him .
this is just the case where they might be invaluable .
you remember that a stonemason , named slater , walking from forest row about one o clock in the morning two days before the murder stopped as he passed the grounds and looked at the square of light still shining among the trees .
we saw it whisk past the light thrown from over the door and disappear against the black shadow of the house .
they may not have realized ,
you are not angry ?
i guess you are new to this part , young man ?
he looked her over in his searching fashion , and then composed himself , with his lids drooping and his finger tips together , to listen to her story .
holmes ,
guilt that was it guilt and fear !
i tell you that i will never stand in the dock .
the bed , the carpet , the chairs the mantelpiece , the dead body , and the rope were each in turn examined , until at last he professed himself satisfied , and with my aid and that of the inspector cut down the wretched object and laid it reverently under a sheet .
here it is .
the old hall , oak panelled and high windowed , had been turned into a court of investigation .
man , man !
is it possible ?
i suppose that there has been no answer from my cabman advertisement ?
sally lives in lodgings at , mayfield place , peckham .
no one has seen him .
it 's only the facts that we want .
i assure you that i am simply here upon a visit to my friend , sir henry , and that i need no help of any kind .
then he approached it , and , standing on tiptoe with his neck craned , he looked into the room .
shall i go for the police ?
and on the morning of the wedding ?
if the man is caught , it will be on account of their exertions if he escapes , it will be in spite of their exertions .
that is why i am here .
it 's been in the papers often enough .
yes , mr holmes .
is it likely that i would have brought you here if it were i ?
hampshire .
the firms have been generous of late .
mcmurdo looked at the man earnestly .
a soft revolver bullet , as you perceive , watson .
here you have the particular district which concerns us .
it was awful to me to think of all those lords and ladies sitting round that breakfast table and waiting for me to come back .
the envelope was destroyed by him .
my brother and i rushed towards the window , but the man was gone .
its master had risen and was staring with flushed cheeks and shining eyes .
a penitentiary job ?
but suddenly they started forward in a rigid , fixed stare , and his lips parted in amazement .
nothing had been stolen or disarranged , and there is absolutely no explanation of what the horror can be which has frightened a woman to death and two strong men out of their senses .
for the very simple reason that i see the dog himself on our very door step , and there is the ring of its owner .
when i spoke of the dart which had so narrowly missed us , she turned so white that i feared that she was about to faint .
at the danish capital he was again a few days late , for they had journeyed on to london , where he at last succeeded in running them to earth .
mr soames was a tall , spare man , of a nervous and excitable temperament .
for my own part i had none of this power of detachment , and the day , in consequence , appeared to be interminable .
precisely so .
i could tell by my companion 's graver face that he also had seen .
it sounds incredible , for i have not , as far as i know , an enemy in the world .
i do n't know what i did .
well , you must wait for him .
i have tried to help her , but i daresay i did it clumsily , and scared her from it .
but you 've heard of pinkerton 's ?
i have five .
that is so .
do you follow your path and i will follow mine .
we know that an american calling himself hargrave came to tunbridge wells two days ago with bicycle and valise .
when these fellows are at fault they come to me , and i manage to put them on the right scent .
he has certainly been an early starter .
pennsylvania small arms company well known american firm ,
they must have done so .
he got down from his window and he went off , either alone or with someone .
now , listen to me , barrymore !
the scent will lie upon the road in spite of their eight and twenty hours ' start .
i am sorry to leave you so far from your house , but there is no alternative .
what have you got there , dr wood ?
holmes considered for a little time .
he was an elderly man , thin , demure , and commonplace by no means the conception one forms of a russian nobleman .
of coming to conclusions too rapidly .
she felt that he was telling the truth .
i took her part , got her into a cab , and here we are .
he had described his household to me before i went there .
but as to my uncle 's death well , it all seems boiling up in my head , and i can n't get it clear yet .
the old reprobate with the surplice burst into a volley of bad language .
if i had n't sworn not to go about alone i might have had a more lively evening , for i had a message from stapleton asking me over there .
a man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become delirious .
i should be happy to make myself useful .
for my sake ?
look at this impression , where you get both tires clear .
besides , we must be prompt , for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits .
von bork sat up in amazement .
he cried .
holmes held up a crumpled branch of flowering gorse .
the night was very dark , so that i can hardly imagine how he could have hoped to see anyone .
it took two , or possibly three , handfuls before the lodger came to the window .
colonel moran sprang forward with a snarl of rage , but the constables dragged him back .
and it may lessen his guilt if i say that it was done in self defence , and that john straker was a man who was entirely unworthy of your confidence .
some people think that a fly in it is a sign .
watson there would tell you that i was a nervous , sensitive boy at school .
halloa , watson , what 's this ?
my wife and three children came with me .
it was equally conceivable that he had shot her and then himself , or that she had been the criminal , for the revolver lay upon the floor midway between them .
he had hardly turned to leave the hut when hopkin 's hand was on the fellow 's collar , and i heard his loud gasp of terror as he understood that he was taken .
by midday my husband and i were on our way to london , but not before he had given our benefactor full warning of this danger , and had also left such information for the police as would safeguard his life for the future .
we are all good friends again and there 's an end of the matter .
have you any of the sort in the house ?
a terrible scream a prolonged yell of horror and anguish burst out of the silence of the moor .
that it was written in a train .
for you have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us .
it was part of the fittings of the professor 's own desk .
it has been touch and go with him ,
he watched over her slumber for some time , but nature proved to be too strong for him .
certainly , but how ?
visited paramore .
the man who tears a wedding ring off a dead man 's what do you say to it , mr holmes ?
has he come with you to night ?
you do n't like being beaten any more than the rest of us do ,
i stood for a minute or two to collect myself , for i was dazed with the horror of the thing .
i may have threatened her god forgive me !
that was the end of my visit to wisteria lodge .
the cry had been loud on account of its vehemence , but it had pealed out from somewhere far off on the shadowy plain .
such a remark is unworthy of you , holmes .
what brings you here ?
and then after you had sent the letter he dissuaded you from keeping the appointment ?
whatever have you been doing with yourself , watson ?
the moon shone upon him , and i could distinguish the dapper shape and jaunty walk of the naturalist .
there were several mortimers , but only one who could be our visitor .
it has been pouring rain and blowing a hurricane ever since ,
clearly because those are words which were not contained in the page in question .
not so fast ,
by the way , a curious paper was found in papa 's desk which no one could understand .
i must compliment you , mr baynes , upon your attention to detail in your examination of it .
and the humbler are usually the more interesting .
but more than that we were never destined to know , though there was much which we might surmise .
it would be injustice to hesitate ,
ferguson appeared to be a morose and silent man , but i could see from the little that he said that he was at least a fellow countryman .
not for worlds .
that all seems clear enough .
but since mr holmes has already been taken into your confidence , it would indeed be absurd that we should not avail ourselves of his services .
sarah avoided me now , but she and mary were just inseparable .
the others ceased at last but baldwin , his cruel face set in an infernal smile , was hacking at the man 's head , which he vainly endeavoured to defend with his arms his white hair was dabbled with patches of blood .
so unworldly was he or so capricious that he frequently refused his help to the powerful and wealthy where the problem made no appeal to his sympathies , while he would devote weeks of most intense application to the affairs of some humble client whose case presented those strange and dramatic qualities which appealed to his imagination and challenged his ingenuity .
if he goes by road with his legs all dripping , it 's odds that someone will notice him .
arrest these men , inspector ,
lodge , chicago .
he dropped on his knees and clapped his ear to the ground .
his plans were suddenly brought to a head by his knowledge that sir charles was about to leave the hall on the advice of dr mortimer , with whose opinion he himself pretended to coincide .
porlock is not quite a sound link between ourselves .
i would only ask you now , sir , whether you have formed any explanation in your own mind as to the mysterious disappearance of your son ?
it is thought that flora decoyed my wife out and laid some terrible trap for her .
i suppose i am the only one in the world .
he held my friend 's card in his hand , and he looked up with no very pleased expression upon his dour features .
it helped us to realize the horror of this woman 's life when we saw the eagerness and joy with which she laid us on her husband 's track .
the photograph was of irene adler herself in evening dress , the letter was superscribed to sherlock holmes , esq .
when we have found who he is and who his associates are , we should have a good start in learning what he was doing in pitt street last night , and who it was who met him and killed him on the doorstep of mr horace harker .
i have , i foresee , a very busy day before me in looking into this case of young openshaw 's .
i straightened it out afterwards .
continued holmes , pointing at the bare slabs of marble .
then it is undoubtedly from him that the note comes ,
our birds are flown and the nest empty ,
he whispered .
i shall counsel her to tell her future husband the whole story and to trust to his generosity .
i am going out now !
we can hardly suppose , mr holmes , that the thief took the treaty in order to frame it and hang it up .
quite so .
i gasped .
he had evidently come with the intention of consulting with sherlock holmes , for on perceiving his colleague he appeared to be embarrassed and put out .
exactly , mr holmes .
i am close on the track of the sholto gang .
then he turned to me .
my cabby drove fast .
there is the less fear of you or me finding one in our skin before long .
it is morally justifiable so long as our object is to take no articles save those which are used for an illegal purpose .
why should such a message stop in such a way ?
is it for such results as this that our great country welcomes to its bosom the alien who flies from the despotisms of europe ?
the three sikhs got penal servitude for life , and i was condemned to death , though my sentence was afterwards commuted into the same as the others .
in the meantime , mr melas , i should certainly be on my guard , if i were you , for of course they must know through these advertisements that you have betrayed them .
do you observe ,
we may put aside this idea of baynes 's that garcia 's servants were concerned in the matter .
when you are quite restored
please forget the words i said , which have no application whatever to you .
she looked round into the shadows of the room .
now , my dear watson , is it beyond the limits of human ingenuity to furnish an explanation which would cover both of these big facts ?
i must ask you first , mr holmes , to glance at this rough plan , which will give you a general idea of the position of the professor 's study and the various points of the case .
very serious , indeed the one thing upon earth which could have disarranged my plans .
when dr mortimer had finished reading this singular narrative he pushed his spectacles up on his forehead and stared across at mr sherlock holmes .
he repeated
you have not made it clear what was colonel moran 's motive in murdering the honourable ronald adair ?
should i be guilty of a liberty if i lit a cigar and placed it between your lips ?
it was a quiet , little , plainly furnished room , with a round table in the centre , on which several german books were scattered .
yet when i spoke to her of the matter , she answered me abruptly and in the carriage , on our way home , she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause .
we have retained these things for some days ,
well , mr holmes , have you solved this mystery yet ?
the hundred waiting miners stood as motionless and helpless as if they were paralyzed .
you may address me as the count von kramm , a bohemian nobleman .
yes , that 's it ,
but i happen to know that dr ainstree , the greatest living authority upon tropical disease , is now in london .
a lean , ferret like man , furtive and sly looking , was waiting for us upon the platform .
here and there there are scattered white objects which glisten in the sun , and stand out against the dull deposit of alkali .
no clue ?
the shaft into which the river hurls itself is an immense chasm , lined by glistening coal black rock , and narrowing into a creaming , boiling pit of incalculable depth , which brims over and shoots the stream onward over its jagged lip .
rochester row ,
yes , i am not very well ,
then you got it by trick .
oh , man , of course .
we picked him out of the gutter , and he will n't leave us so easily .
well , i do n't know about that , sir
it is both , or none ,
the official was a white faced unemotional man , who went through his duties in a dull mechanical way .
if he has been working among us all that time with the railroad money at his back , i should expect that he has got results , and that he has passed them on .
at night time they chose the base of a beetling crag , where the rocks offered some protection from the chill wind , and there huddled together for warmth , they enjoyed a few hours ' sleep .
the bar of mcginty 's saloon was crowded as usual for it was the favourite loafing place of all the rougher elements of the town .
from the time that i heard of the assistant having come for half wages , it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the situation .
but mr henderson , of high gable , was by all accounts a curious man to whom curious adventures might befall .
a moment later the servants ' door was opened , and mr joseph harrison stepped out into the moonlight .
well , what the hell do you want ?
i think that i shall be in a position to make the situation rather more clear to you before long .
knows nothing of practical gardening .
a lover evidently , for who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to you ?
it was just a benefit club and a meeting place for one 's fellows .
i made notes of my patient 's pulse and temperature , tested the rigidity of his muscles , and examined his reflexes .
the night was a windy one , with broken clouds drifting swiftly across the face of a three quarter moon .
it was young stanley hopkins , a promising detective , in whose career holmes had several times shown a very practical interest .
now he sat for some time in thought with his face sunk in his hands .
stand right back !
why , i was first reserve for england against wales , and i 've skippered the ' varsity all this year .
you have made the affair far more difficult .
his manners towards the maid servants were disgustingly free and familiar .
with which inconsequent remark he strode on into the house , followed by gregson , whose features expressed his astonishment .
i thought i 'd bring him round myself then he could n't slip away .
a minute examination of the circumstances served only to make the case more complex .
i sprang in beside him and we drove on .
there is no safety for your husband in england .
he held it out , as he spoke , upon the palm of his hand .
been numerous petty thefts .
i was horrified by my first glimpse of holmes next morning , for he sat by the fire holding his tiny hypodermic syringe .
but say nothing to anyone upon the matter .
by the select prices .
miller hill is an ill kept public park in the very centre of the town .
no , no , my dear sir such a course is utterly impossible .
it is true that you have missed everything of importance , but you have hit upon the method , and you have a quick eye for colour .
but that is the very thing which you have so often cautioned me not to do .
so interested was he that i had to repeat some of it twice before he was satisfied .
when did you first meet miss hatty doran ?
the regiment was stationed in india at the time , and before i could join it , the second afghan war had broken out .
he leaned back in his seat , lost in gloomy speculation .
it is not an english paper at all .
on examination i found that such a combination formed the termination of the message which was three times repeated .
and you do n't know his address ?
for the matter of that , why should mcfarlane ?
that was all right .
you mean well , watson ,
we sat in the strasburg salle manger arguing the question for half an hour , but the same night we had resumed our journey and were well on our way to geneva .
dear , dear , one of the oldest families in the county of norfolk , and one of the most honoured .
he has come back and done it .
he relapsed at once into the half humorous , half cynical vein which was his habitual attitude to those about him .
yes , it was adams
but there is a connection between bodymaster mcginty and the valley of fear .
here we paid off our cab , and with our great coats buttoned up , for it was bitterly cold , and the wind seemed to blow through us , we walked along the edge of the heath .
it had only lain there a few days .
only two hours , watson .
whose house is it ?
one towel passed round the throat and was secured at the back of the pillar .
at the best it must take some time ,
that is two days after mrs warren 's lodger arrived .
so it would seem .
one would think they were the only geese in the world , to hear the fuss that is made over them .
why , dear me , it is surely hudson ,
holmes , with a laugh , passed his hand behind the child 's ear , a mask peeled off from her countenance , and there was a little coal black negress , with all her white teeth flashing in amusement at our amazed faces .
i stared at it horror stricken , not knowing what was about to issue from it .
then he peered into the darkness , blew the candle out , and threw it on the floor .
as we watched it the fog wreaths came crawling round both corners of the house and rolled slowly into one dense bank on which the upper floor and the roof floated like a strange ship upon a shadowy sea .
what say you , watson ?
our visitor again passed his hand over his forehead , as if he found it bitterly hard .
the prisoner lay with his face towards us , in a very deep sleep , breathing slowly and heavily .
i sprang up and rang for the servant .
i may say that i was his personal friend as well as his medical attendant .
not after he went into the station .
the little which i had yet to learn of the case was told me by sherlock holmes as we travelled back next day .
remember that only english notes , or gold , will be taken .
the injured man was laid on his bed , and at holmes 's request i examined him .
any number of them are ready to swear that they have seen such a creature upon the moor .
i came personally , mr holmes , in order to insure that you would return with me .
stapleton , as i will continue to call him , knew that the old man 's heart was weak and that a shock would kill him .
personally i am in agreement with dr armstrong , and football does not come within my horizon .
you 'll be the new captain ?
so your grave , middle aged family practitioner vanishes into thin air , my dear watson , and there emerges a young fellow under thirty , amiable , unambitious , absent minded , and the possessor of a favourite dog , which i should describe roughly as being larger than a terrier and smaller than a mastiff .
in half an hour we had reached pitt street , a quiet little backwater just beside one of the briskest currents of london life .
this i was able to do by securing the position of governess in his family .
not at all .
well , watson ,
it was adams , of course .
you have murdered your brother .
well , last monday evening i was taking a stroll down that way , when i met an empty van coming up the lane , and saw a pile of carpets and things lying about on the grass plot beside the porch .
well , we have seen some very interesting things .
a desk stood in the centre , with a turning chair of shining red leather .
it is a very queer place , the queerest that ever i was in , and i have been in some rum corners , too .
out we ran , and there on the poop were the lieutenant and ten of his men .
it 's a friend of mine , mr baldwin , a new boarder here .
a few articles of furniture and a supply of food and water were within , together with a number of books and papers .
he had tracked us down somehow , and had set himself to live upon our fears .
yes , i 've had a busy day ,
let us look at it from his point of view .
john rance appeared to be somewhat irritated at this digression .
why did you pick him ?
then he drew the key from the outer door , passed through after me , and locked it on the outside .
there was no quarrel between them and she can give no motive for his action .
but i shall come back in the evening at the hour you have mentioned , for i should like to see the solution of so tangled a business .
i handed him the letter , which he read with the most concentrated attention .
musgrave still stood with a very pale face , swinging his lantern and peering down into the hole .
i began to smell a rat .
it was maddening to think that the hiding place was on his very lips at the moment that he died .
one turned sideways as he dug his nails into the edge of it .
i ran to the back and got some water , but i could not bring her to .
you should have been behind the hedge , then you would have had a close view of this interesting person .
there is not , and there never has been , any such person .
beg pardon , sir ,
do you receive much company ?
but i felt that my school had reached its zenith when , weeks ago , the duke of holdernesse sent mr james wilder , his secretary , with intimation that young lord saltire , ten years old , his only son and heir , was about to be committed to my charge .
i had confidence , however , in my own youth and energy , and was convinced that in a very few years the concern would be as flourishing as ever .
no , i have not .
he has no children , keeps one maid servant , and is comfortably off .
i had heard him mention the case more than once , though i had never been able to gather the details .
holmes cast a swift glance of triumph at me .
it is impossible that it should be a mere coincidence .
sir henry has , i suppose , no superstitious fears in the matter ?
we have still ten minutes .
in the surgeon 's deposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon .
at half past twelve we found ourselves upon the steps of mrs warren 's house a high , thin , yellow brick edifice in great orme street , a narrow thoroughfare at the northeast side of the british museum .
trust me , jack !
you think that he was waiting for someone ?
this is a very deep business ,
his broad , grizzled head , with its shining patch of baldness , was in the immediate foreground of our vision .
but a new element has been introduced into the case which may account for his leading the horse from the stable .
i 'm delighted to have them , for the chances are that they are all he has .
aldgate , where the body was found , is considerably past the station london bridge , which would be his route to woolwich .
the air had turned chill and we withdrew into the hut for warmth .
hosmer mr angel was a cashier in an office in leadenhall street and
it seems that there had been some informality about their license , that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them without a witness of some sort , and that my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in search of a best man .
when the light of the hall lamp fell upon our midnight visitor , i had no difficulty in recognizing him .
the interplay of ideas and the oblique uses of knowledge are often of extraordinary interest .
will n't you tell us what has happened ?
the latest tenants of the manor house had , however , with characteristic energy , set this right , and the drawbridge was not only capable of being raised , but actually was raised every evening and lowered every morning .
yes he bought a practice as i did .
yet our invitation was either a complete hoax , which was an inconceivable hypothesis , or else we had good reason to think that important issues might hang upon our journey .
but dark or fair , she is my own dear little girlie , and her mother 's pet .
i did so , and saw a large e with a small g , a p , and a large g with a small t woven into the texture of the paper .
at the same moment a vague shadowy figure emerged from the gap for which they had been making , and uttered the plaintive signal cry again , on which a second man appeared out of the obscurity .
disguised , and under an assumed name , he returned to salt lake city , careless what became of his own life , as long as he obtained what he knew to be justice .
my word , it does not seem a very cheerful place ,
again , of course no subordinate would have dared to do such a thing .
my nerves cannot stand it .
it is such a pity !
but one thing i will say first .
the third house on the right hand side is a bird stuffer 's : sherman is the name .
now , mr brown , i am quite at your disposal .
inside the house we were met by the elderly cornish housekeeper , mrs porter , who , with the aid of a young girl , looked after the wants of the family .
i have some account of the matter here , i believe .
then , in his last breath , he tried to send a message that it was she the she whom he had just discussed with him .
all that i learned was through the columns of a newspaper .
why have n't you seen boss mcginty yet ?
how could he ?
oh , jack , see i beg it of you on my bended knees !
for two streets he shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot .
why , gregson !
in that safe .
there are no crimes and no criminals in these days ,
the great national importance of the issue , the suspense in high quarters , the direct nature of the experiment which we were trying all combined to work upon my nerve .
we will suppose , for argument 's sake , that young cadogan west had determined to convey these papers to london .
none as yet .
be that as it might , i seemed to see that woman 's figure still clutching at her treasure trove and flying wildly up the winding stair , with her ears ringing perhaps with the muffled screams from behind her and with the drumming of frenzied hands against the slab of stone which was choking her faithless lover 's life out .
seclusion i can understand but why print ?
head attendant at the hotel cosmopolitan .
also that if page finds us only in the second chapter , the length of the first one must have been really intolerable .
if i backed down i knew well what would come to me .
he was a good hearted man when he was sober , but a perfect fiend when he was drunk , or rather when he was half drunk , for he seldom really went the whole way .
mr merryweather stopped to light a lantern , and then conducted us down a dark , earth smelling passage , and so , after opening a third door , into a huge vault or cellar , which was piled all round with crates and massive boxes .
i was foolish enough to go into the empty wing , ' i answered .
not a livin ' soul , sir , nor as much as a dog .
it is impossible to exclude them when the church is open .
that , i am sure , cannot be true ,
this agra treasure intervened like an impassable barrier between us .
jim was shot last month when they tried to kill chester wilcox of marley creek ,
a horrible doubt came into my mind as i approached the door lest the dog might be loose , but i remembered that toller had drunk himself into a state of insensibility that evening , and i knew that he was the only one in the household who had any influence with the savage creature , or who would venture to set him free .
vincent spaulding did what he could to cheer me up , but by bedtime i had reasoned myself out of the whole thing .
do you follow ?
a russian nobleman who is now resident in england , ' it runs , ' would be glad to avail himself of the professional assistance of dr percy trevelyan .
in case he wished to ask any questions .
a few seconds sufficed to satisfy him , for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket .
i suppose he would .
the situation is becoming an impossible one .
quite a little parlour game sort of three card trick , is it not ?
now , i 'll tell you how it stands with me .
what a very shocking affair !
that is as much as i have been able to gather about the families .
how very unfortunate , watson !
and he is a man with a wooden leg ?
if i remember right , he stumbled over a heap of stones , looked up at the stars , and so on .
you traced him through the telegram , no doubt ,
so say the serpentine mews , to a man .
on the contrary , your statement is singularly lucid .
i thought it as well to have jones with us also .
there was no response .
where your calling is more open to criticism is when you pry into the secrets of private individuals , when you rake up family matters which are better hidden , and when you incidentally waste the time of men who are more busy than yourself .
well , the worse luck for someone else !
well , sir , it was a bit rumpled , certainly , when i came back .
a thorough search was quickly made , and the body was discovered .
i have often seen them there .
they were all most dangerous men .
the alternative develops .
you will leave the papers here , and remember the advice which i have given you .
payment in hard cash when goods delivered .
he certainly seemed to be getting uncomfortably near the truth .
holmes glanced at me and raised his eyebrows sardonically .
i beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour me with some details as to your case .
why will n't you tell me ?
impossible !
and am i to remain here ?
we are only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime .
all were deserted .
my mind is like a racing engine , tearing itself to pieces because it is not connected up with the work for which it was built .
ask for pompey from jeremy dixon , trinity college .
there was no trace then of the horror which i had myself felt at this curt declaration but his face showed rather the quiet and interested composure of the chemist who sees the crystals falling into position from his oversaturated solution .
no , sir
if ever i permit you to chronicle any more of my little problems , watson , i foresee that you will enliven your pages by an account of the singular adventure of the napoleonic busts .
what could you go into the post office for , then , but to send a wire ?
read holmes .
the third flight of stairs ended in a straight passage of some length , with a great picture in indian tapestry upon the right of it and three doors upon the left .
i stayed with him all the evening , and it was on that occasion , to explain the emotion which he had shown , that he confided to my keeping that narrative which i read to you when first i came .
yes , sir
there will be a dreadful row at woolwich if they are not returned .
the colonel possessed a varied collection of weapons brought from the different countries in which he had fought , and it is conjectured by the police that his club was among his trophies .
on his evidence cartwright was hanged and the other three got fifteen years apiece .
he admits it .
but i , who knew how he winced from the very thought of death , had much ado to persuade myself that he had gone out of his way to meet it .
and can n't i speak alone with a gentleman for five minutes but you must butt in on us ?
better close the front door ,
address : conduit street .
louis .
i did not know .
go straight back to london , instantly .
then perhaps i had better postpone my analysis of the acetones , as we may need to be at our best in the morning .
i think that i can engage to clear you of the charge .
many men have been hanged on far slighter evidence ,
and what then ?
can you name the man who did it ?
now , presuming that there was some understanding between simpson and these gypsies , might he not have been leading the horse to them when he was overtaken , and may they not have him now ?
we will go straight to whitehall terrace and bring the matter to a head .
well , he can come if he wants ,
still , of course , i never dared to leave the room for an instant , for i was not sure when he might come , and the billet was such a good one , and suited me so well , that i would not risk the loss of it .
at the second glance , however , i perceived that there was a man standing in the southampton road , a small bearded man in a grey suit , who seemed to be looking in my direction .
but i see that the enemy 's preparations have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light .
that she is wherever sir george burnwell is .
the july which immediately succeeded my marriage was made memorable by three cases of interest , in which i had the privilege of being associated with sherlock holmes and of studying his methods .
by jove !
no , sir henry , you must take with you someone , a trusty man , who will be always by your side .
the same may be said , my dear fellow , for the effect of some of these little sketches of yours , which is entirely meretricious , depending as it does upon your retaining in your own hands some factors in the problem which are never imparted to the reader .
percy phelps .
i should like to know who sold you the geese which you supplied to the alpha .
they got this man down here at a time when everything was still and yet no one was asleep .
as i did the same i felt the hand of the man behind me grab at my ankle , but i kicked myself free and scrambled over a grass strewn coping .
because then , again , she would have left me , and i could n't bear to face that .
the look of anger passed in an instant from his face .
but the next instant holmes had emptied five barrels of his revolver into the creature 's flank .
his name is hugh boone , and his hideous face is one which is familiar to every man who goes much to the city .
how could i search for it without the french police having their suspicions aroused ?
inference that she had been in england some little time , but he had not been in greece .
we had reached our house in baker street while we had been talking .
i do n't care about knuckling under to any man , as these folk do to their darned prophet .
no i told my wife what to answer and she went down to write it .
arrest you !
meanwhile , hope , we cannot neglect all our other duties on account of this one misfortune .
and what would he do with it ?
i have , as you know , devoted some attention to this , and written a little monograph on the ashes of different varieties of pipe , cigar , and cigarette tobacco .
the dog is let loose at night to prevent him from endeavouring to communicate with her .
pshaw , my dear boy !
he continued with an exulting smile upon his face .
we thought that perhaps you would care to step across , mr holmes .
but what is it ?
i felt a creeping of the flesh , and a presentiment of coming horror , even before sherlock holmes answered .

i give you my word on the book that i never raised hand against mr sholto .
you must speak to her in the morning , or i will if you prefer it .
the rules say so .

there were , it is true , some blood stains upon his right shirt sleeve , but he pointed to his ring finger , which had been cut near the nail , and explained that the bleeding came from there , adding that he had been to the window not long before , and that the stains which had been observed there came doubtless from the same source .

there is no vehicle save a dog cart which throws up mud in that way , and then only when you sit on the left hand side of the driver .
the skylight above was open , and the prisoner gone .
the packet was posted on thursday morning .
but since we see that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace it , it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly , which is a distinct proof of a weakening nature .
by the way , i do n't suppose you appreciate that we have been mourning over you as having broken your neck ?
pencils , too , and knives all was satisfactory .
i had hoped ,
he was a man of such gigantic strength that , even with the handcuffs which holmes had so deftly fastened upon his wrists , he would have very quickly overpowered my friend had hopkins and i not rushed to his rescue .
i have not seen a man who , if he turns his talents that way , was more calculated to fill the gap left by the illustrious moriarty .
i saw the old man throw up his arms , a terrible convulsion passed over his grim face , and he fell back in his chair .
holmes laughed .
that is mr soames ' tea time .
does it come out of the business ?
may i introduce you to mr sherlock holmes ?
prendergast threw us over a chart , told us that we were shipwrecked mariners whose ship had foundered in lat .
cried poor , distracted ettie .
then once more the footsteps approached and a shadow fell across the opening of the hut .
it was there last night .
i should not have intruded it upon your attention had you not shown some incredulity the other day .
she might almost personify britannia ,
our only chance of safety lay in making a clean job of it , said he , and he would not leave a tongue with power to wag in a witness box .
must withdraw offer unless contract completed .
if my friend would undertake it there is no man who is better worth having at your side when you are in a tight place .
i need hardly tell you that i am taking a very grave responsibility upon myself in doing this .
you bet i was giving nothing away .
i found sherlock holmes alone , however , half asleep , with his long , thin form curled up in the recesses of his armchair .
then there was hollis .
now , at present i am in the position of these same readers , for i hold in this hand several threads of one of the strangest cases which ever perplexed a man 's brain , and yet i lack the one or two which are needful to complete my theory .
i saw my own comrades hacked to pieces at maiwand without losing my nerve .
well , gentlemen ,
well , to my surprise and delight , everything was as right as possible .
he was a most daring and successful seal and whale fisher .
no argument or persuasion could ever induce him to set up a female establishment after the manner of his companions .
the more popular he became , however , with the freemen , the blacker were the scowls which greeted him as he passed along the streets of vermissa .
good day , lord st .
it can be stated for certain that this young man , when he met his death , was travelling in this direction at some late hour of the night , but at what point he entered the train it is impossible to state .
what became of the hound when its master was in london ?
i wish that he were here .
he seemed to be stirring up the moat with something which he held in his hand .
very good , sir
but i certainly did not know that the aurora was such a clipper .
his boots , his socks , his hat , and his watch all were there .
i was , as you may think , watson , horrified at this unexpected news .
now i make one with my naked foot beside it .
i took a few of my friends into the secret , however , and they suggested that we should quietly and secretly work our own little deposit and that in this way we should earn the money which would enable us to buy the neighbouring fields .
a serious epidemic broke out in the school and three of the boys died .
my brother and i used to think this a mere whim of my father 's , but events have since led us to change our opinion .

let me know the moment you have news .
he felt his way among the furniture , opened another door , and closed it behind us .
at some evidence implicating flora millar in the disappearance .
on the third day after the coming of the letter my father went from home to visit an old friend of his , major freebody , who is in command of one of the forts upon portsdown hill .
with a premonition of his fate he had refused to take me with him .
that is the situation for the discussion of which i have made a claim of urgency .
he has never seen a gun of this sort in the house .
ah , yes , my friend !
but i was still far from satisfied .
i 'm sure i congratulate you both with all my heart .
you want to go home , no doubt , doctor ,
we 'll talk about it when we 've had something to eat .
ah yes , i recall the case it was concerned with an opal tiara .

it has been the most jealously guarded of all government secrets .
stand back !
has a white splash of acid upon his forehead .
then it lengthened out until it became a yellow line , and then , without any warning or sound , a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared , a white , almost womanly hand , which felt about in the centre of the little area of light .
he seems a very amiable person ,
there are one or two minor points which were brought out in the inquest , and which are worth considering .
i was forced , therefore , to consider seriously the hypothesis that she had remained within the house .
of course , he was quite dead , and had been so from the instant that he had uttered that last yell of agony .
or it may be that they wish , for their own purposes , to scare me away .
i wonder what your friend holmes would do if he were here .

i listened with amazement to this explanation , which holmes delivered between the puffs of his cigarette .
for years i had gradually weaned him from that drug mania which had threatened once to check his remarkable career .
i trust that mrs watson has entirely recovered from all the little excitements connected with our adventure of the sign of four .
the next step is the note received by garcia at the dinner .
mr holmes ,
the words were hardly out of my mouth when we both saw him .
i explained .
there is nothing in common between my father and me ,
the most extraordinary and tragic affair has occurred during the night .
good god !
i have a great fancy to see this lodger of yours , mrs warren .
the maid was gone .
and then at last i heard him .
inspector gregory was full of his case , and poured out a stream of remarks , while holmes threw in an occasional question or interjection .
all right , barrymore , you can go .
his face was lean and haggard , and the brown parchment like skin was drawn tightly over the projecting bones his long , brown hair and beard were all flecked and dashed with white his eyes were sunken in his head , and burned with an unnatural lustre while the hand which grasped his rifle was hardly more fleshy than that of a skeleton .
i 'd go some way to see him get his deserts .
that is all very certain .

who he was or what he wanted is more than i can tell .
do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help ?
to this one purpose i must now devote all my energies .
it may be that i am myself at fault for not following up the hint which you conveyed to me through my friend , dr watson but , at that time i had every reason to believe that you were directly concerned in the crime .
i 'll find him through the operator .
i wonder i did n't drop .
so great was his emotion , that i felt sincerely sorry for him , while the two detectives smiled derisively , by no means displeased at this check which he had met .
from over a distant rise there floated a gray plume of smoke .
and in this letter you certainly have a very strong piece of evidence to corroborate your view .
these girls !
holmes sat in silence for some little time .

you remind me of edgar allen poe 's dupin .
when they were dressed they found that the others had stolen out , leaving the door open behind them .
i at once saw the horrible danger of my position , and i hurried to put the case into your hands .

and the criminal ?
holmes gave a whistle of surprise .
god help us !
